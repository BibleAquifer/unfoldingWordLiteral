\p 
\v 20 And they were helped against them, and the Hagrites were given into their hand and all who were with them. For they cried out to God in the battle, and he granted their entreaty because they trusted in him.
\p 
\v 21 And they took captive their livestock: their camels 50,000, and sheep 250,000, and donkeys 2,000, and living people 100,000.
\p 
\v 22 For many fell slain because the battle was from God. And they lived in their place until the exile.

\v 13 And Saul died because of his infidelity which he was unfaithful to Yahweh on account of the word of Yahweh which he did not keep, and also to ask a medium to seek,
\p 
\v 14 and he did not seek Yahweh, and he killed him. And he turned the kingdom to David, the son of Jesse.
\c 11
\p 
\v 1 And all Israel gathered to David at Hebron, saying, “Look, your bones and your flesh are we.
\p 
\v 2 Even yesterday also the day before that, even when Saul was king, you were the one who brought out and the one who brought in Israel. And Yahweh your God said to you, ‘You yourself will shepherd my people, Israel, and you yourself will be leader over my people Israel.’”
\p 
\v 3 And all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and David cut with them a covenant at Hebron before the face of Yahweh. And they anointed David king over Israel according to the word of Yahweh by the hand of Samuel.
\p 
\v 4 And David went and all Israel to Jerusalem; that is, Jebus. And there were the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land.
\p 
\v 5 And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, “You will not come in here.” But David captured the stronghold of Zion, that is, the city of David.
\p 
\v 6 And David said, “Whoever strikes down the Jebusites first will become head and chief.” And Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, and he became head.
\p 
\v 7 And David lived in the stronghold; therefore they called it the city of David.
\p 
\v 8 And he built the city all around, from the Millo and as far as that which surrounds. And Joab restored the rest of the city.
\p 
\v 9 And David went, going and becoming great, and Yahweh of Hosts was with him.
\p 
\v 10 And these, the heads of the mighty ones who belonged to David strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of Yahweh concerning Israel.
\p 
\v 11 And these, the number of the mighty ones who belonged to David: Jashobeam, a son of a Hachmonite, the head of the officers. He swung his spear against 300, slain at one time.
\p 
\v 12 And after him, Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, he among the three mighty ones.
\p 
\v 13 He was with David at Pas Dammim, and the Philistines had assembled there for battle. And there was a portion of the field full of barley. And the peope fled from the faces of the Philistines.
\p 
\v 14 And they took their stand in the midst of the portion. And they delivered it, and they struck down the Philistines. And Yahweh saved a great salvation.
\p 
\v 15 And three from the 30 heads went down to the rock to David, to the cave of Adullam. And the camp of the Philistines encamped in the Valley of Rephaim.
\p 
\v 16 And David then was in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines then was in Bethlehem.
\p 
\v 17 And David desired, and he said, “Who will give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem which is by the gate?”
\p 
\v 18 And the three broke through the camp of the Philistines, and they drew water from the well of Bethlehem which was by the gate. And they carried, and they brought to David. But David was not willing to drink it, and he poured it out to Yahweh.
\p 
\v 19 And he said, “Far be it from me before my God from doing this! Do I drink the blood of these men with their lives? For with their lives they brought it.” And he was not willing to drink it. These, the three mighty ones did.
\p 
\v 20 And Abshai, the brother of Joab, he was the head of the Three. And he swung his spear against 300, slain. And to him a name among the Three.
\p 
\v 21 From the Three, in the second he was honored and he became to them a chief, but up to the Three he did not enter.
\p 
\v 22 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a man of strength, great deeds, from Kabzeel. He himself struck down the two of Ariel of Moab. And he himself went down, and he struck down the lion in the midst of the pit on the day of the snow.
\p 
\v 23 And he himself struck down the man of Egypt, a man of stature, five cubits. And in the hand of the Egyptian, a spear like the beam of weavers, but he went down to him with a staff. And he seized the spear from the hand of the Egyptian, and he killed him with his spear.
\p 
\v 24 These, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did, and to him a name among the three mighty ones.
\p 
\v 25 From the 30, behold, he himself was honored, but to the three, he did not enter. And David set him over his bodyguard.

\c 12
\p 
\v 1 And these, the ones who came to David at Ziklag, while he was one restrained from the face of Saul the son of Kish. And they were among the mighty ones, helping the battle.
\p 
\v 2 They were armed with a bow, right-handed and left-handed with stones and with arrows with the bow, from the brothers of Saul, from Benjamin.
\p 
\v 3 The head, Ahiezer, and Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite, and Jeziel and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth, and Berakah, and Jehu the Anathothite,

\p 
\v 8 And from the Gadites they separated themselves to David at the stronghold in the wilderness, mighty in strength, men of the army for battle, ready with shield and spear, and faces of lions were their faces, and like gazelles on the hills to hasten.

\p 
\v 15 These, they who passed over the Jordan in the first month, and it was filling over all its banks, and caused to flee all the valleys, to the east and to the west.
\p 
\v 16 And from the sons of Benjamin and Judah came to the stronghold to David.
\p 
\v 17 And David went out before their faces, and he answered, and he said to them: “If for peace you have come to me, to help me, my heart will be to you all for unity. But if to betray me to my adversaries, with no violence in my palms, may the God of our fathers see and rebuke.”
\p 
\v 18 And the Spirit clothed Amasai, the head of the 30: “To you, O David, and with you, O Son of Jesse. Peace, peace to you and peace to the one who helps you, for your God has helped you.” And David received them and placed them as the heads of the troop.
\p 
\v 19 And from Manasseh fell upon David when he went with the Philistines against Saul to battle. And they did not help them because by counsel the governors of the Philistines sent them away, saying, “By our heads he will fall to his lord, Saul.”
\p 
\v 20 In his going to Ziklag, they fell upon him from Manasseh: Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zillethai, the heads of the thousands who were of Manasseh.
\p 
\v 21 And they helped with David against the troop, for mighty ones of strength, all of them, and they were chiefs in the army.
\p 
\v 22 For at the time of day by day, they were coming to David to help him, until there was a great camp, like the camp of God.
\p 
\v 23 And these, the numbers of the heads of those equipped for war. They came to David at Hebron to turn the kingdom of Saul to him according to the mouth of Yahweh.
\p 
\v 24 The sons of Judah, those carrying shield and spear, 6,800, equipped for war.

\v 28 And Zadok, a young, mighty one of strength, and the house of his father, 22 chiefs.
\p 
\v 29 And from the sons of Benjamin, the brothers of Saul, 3,000. And until then the majority of them were keeping the charge of the house of Saul.
\p 
\v 30 And from the sons of Ephraim, 20,800 mighty ones of strength, men of names, according to the house of their fathers.
\p 
\v 31 And from the half tribe of Manasseh, 18,000 who were marked by names to come to make David king.
\p 
\v 32 And from the sons of Issachar, those who knew understanding of the times to know what Israel should do, their heads, 200, and all their brothers according to their mouth.

\p 
\v 38 All these men of battle, helpers of the battle line; with a whole heart, they came to Hebron to make David king over all Israel. And also all the rest of Israel was of one heart to make David king.
\p 
\v 39 And they were there with David three days, eating and drinking, for their brothers had prepared for them.
\p 
\v 40 And also, those near to them, as far as Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, were bringing bread on donkeys, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen; food of flour, fig cakes, and raisins cakes, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep, in abundance, for joy was in Israel.
\c 13
\p 
\v 1 And David consulted with the chiefs of thousands and of hundreds, to every leader.
\p 
\v 2 And David said to all the assembly of Israel, “If to you all it is good, and from Yahweh our God, let us break out, let us send to our brothers who remain in all the regions of Israel, and with them the priests and the Levites in the cities of their pasturelands. And let them gather to us.
\p 
\v 3 And let us return the Box of our God to us, for we did not seek it in the days of Saul.”
\p 
\v 4 And all the assembly said to do thus, for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.
\p 
\v 5 And David assembled all Israel from Shihor of Egypt and as far as Lebo Hamath, to bring in the Box of God from Kiriath Jearim.
\p 
\v 6 And David went up and all Israel to Baalah, to Kiriath Jearim, which belongs to Judah, to bring up from there the Box of God Yahweh who sits over the cherubim which is called by name.
\p 
\v 7 And they transported the Box of God on a new cart from the house of Abinadab; and Uzzah and Ahio were driving the cart.
\p 
\v 8 And David and all Israel were celebrating before the face of God with all might, and with songs, and lyres, and harps, and tambourines, and cymbals, and trumpets.
\p 
\v 9 And they came to the threshing floor of Kidon, and Uzzah sent out his hand to grasp the Box for the oxen stumbled.
\p 
\v 10 And the anger of Yahweh burned against Uzzah, and He struck him down because he sent out his hand on the Box. And he died there before the face of God.
\p 
\v 11 And David became angry because Yahweh broke out a breaking out against Uzzah. And he called that place Perez Uzzah until this day.
\p 
\v 12 And David feared God in that day, saying, “How will I bring to myself the Box of God?”
\p 
\v 13 And David did not remove the Box to himself, to the city of David, but he turned it to the house of Obed Edom the Gittite.
\p 
\v 14 And the Box of God dwelt with the house of Obed Edom in his house three months. And Yahweh blessed the house of Obed Edom and all that belonged to him.
\c 14
\p 
\v 1 And Hiram the king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and wood of cedar, and craftsmen of a wall, and craftsmen of wood to build for him a house.
\p 
\v 2 And David knew that Yahweh had established him as king over Israel, that his kingdom was lifted upwards for the sake of his people Israel.
\p 
\v 3 And David took more wives in Jerusalem, and David fathered more sons and daughters.
\p 
\v 4 And these, the names of those born who were to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,
\p 
\v 5 and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpelet,
\p 
\v 6 and Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,
\p 
\v 7 and Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphelet.
\p 
\v 8 Now the Philistines heard that David was anointed as king over all Israel, and all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard and went out before their faces.
\p 
\v 9 And the Philistines went, and they raided in the Valley of Rephaim.
\p 
\v 10 Then David asked God, saying, “Should I go up against the Philistines? And will you give them into my hand?” And Yahweh said to him, “Go up and I will give them into your hand.”
\p 
\v 11 And they went up to Baal Perazim, and David struck them down there. And David said, “God has broken through my enemies by my hand like a breaking through of waters.” Therefore they called the name of that place Baal Perazim.
\p 
\v 12 And they abandoned their gods there, and David ordered, and they were burned with fire.
\p 
\v 13 And the Philistines acted yet again, and they raided in the valley.
\p 
\v 14 And David asked God again. And God said to him, “Do not go up after them; circle around from upon them and come at them in front of the balsam trees.
\p 
\v 15 And it shall be when you hear the sound of the marching in the heads of the balsam trees, at that time you shall go out in battle. For God has gone out before your face to strike down the camp of the Philistines.”
\p 
\v 16 And David did just as God commanded him. And he struck down the camp of the Philistines, from Gibeon and as far as Gezer.
\p 
\v 17 And the name of David went out into all the lands, and Yahweh placed the fear of him on all the nations.
\c 15
\p 
\v 1 And he made for himself houses in the city of David. And he prepared a place for the Box of God, and he stretched out a tent for it.
\p 
\v 2 Then David said, “No one shall carry the Box of God, but only the Levites. For them Yahweh chose to carry the Box of Yahweh and to minister for him forever.”
\p 
\v 3 And David assembled all Israel to Jerusalem to bring up the Box of Yahweh to its place which he had prepared for it.
\p 
\v 4 And David gathered the sons of Aaron and the Levites.
\p 
\v 5 Of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief and his brothers, 120.
\p 
\v 6 Of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief and his brothers, 220.
\p 
\v 7 Of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief and his brothers, 130.
\p 
\v 8 Of the sons of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the chief and his brothers, 200.
\p 
\v 9 Of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief and his brothers, 80.
\p 
\v 10 Of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief and his brothers, 112.
\p 
\v 11 And David called for Zadok and for Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab.
\p 
\v 12 And he said to them, “You are the heads of the fathers of the Levites. Consecrate yourselves, you and your brothers, and bring up the Box of Yahweh, the God of Israel, to where I prepared for it.
\p 
\v 13 Because at the first it was not you, Yahweh our God broke out against us, for we did not seek him according to the judgment.”
\p 
\v 14 And the priests and the Levites consecrated themselves to bring up the Box of Yahweh, the God of Israel.
\p 
\v 15 And the sons of Levi carried the Box of God just as Moses commanded, according to the word of Yahweh, on their shoulders with poles on them.
\p 
\v 16 And David said to the chiefs of the Levites to assign their brothers as the singers with instruments of song, harps, and lyres, and cymbals, playing to raise a sound of joy.
\p 
\v 17 And the Levites assigned Heman the son of Joel and from his brothers, Asaph the son of Berechiah, and from the sons of Merari their brothers, Ethan the son of Kushaiah,
\p 
\v 18 and with them, their brothers of the second rank: Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obed Edom, and Jeiel, the gatekeepers.
\p 
\v 19 And the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, with bronze cymbals to play.
\p 
\v 20 And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah with harps, according to Alamoth.
\p 
\v 21 And Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obed Edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah with lyres, according to the Sheminith to lead.
\p 
\v 22 And Kenaniah, the chief of the Levites in lifting up, an instructor in lifting up, for he was one who understood.
\p 
\v 23 And Berechiah and Elkanah, gatekeepers for the Box.
\p 
\v 24 And Shebaniah, and Joshaphat, and Nethanel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, the ones to blow the trumpets before the face of the Box of God. And Obed Edom and Jehiah, gatekeepers for the Box.
\p 
\v 25 And it happened David, and the elders of Israel, and the chiefs of thousands were going to bring up the Box of the covenant of Yahweh from the house of Obed Edom with joy.
\p 
\v 26 And it happened when God helped the Levites carrying the Box of the covenant of Yahweh, and they slaughtered seven bulls and seven rams.
\p 
\v 27 And David was clothed in a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites carrying the Box, and the singers, and Kenaniah, the chief of the lifting up of the singers. And on David, an ephod of linen.
\p 
\v 28 And all Israel was bringing up the Box of the covenant of Yahweh with shouting of joy, and with a sound of a horn and with trumpets, and with cymbals, playing with harps and lyres.
\p 
\v 29 And it happened the Box of the covenant of Yahweh was coming to the city of David, and Michal the daughter of Saul, looked down out of the window. And she saw the king, David, dancing and celebrating. And she despised him in her heart.
\c 16
\p 
\v 1 And they brought in the Box of God and put it in the midst of the tent that David streched out for it. And they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the face of God.
\p 
\v 2 And David finished bringing up the burnt offering and the peace offerings, and he blessed the people in the name of Yahweh.
\p 
\v 3 And he distributed to each person of Israel, from man and as far as woman, to each a loaf of bread, and a date cake, and a raisin cake.
\p 
\v 4 And he appointed before the face of the Box of Yahweh from the Levites as ones who minister, and to commemorate and to thank and to praise Yahweh, the God of Israel.
\p 
\v 5 Asaph the head, and second to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed Edom, and Jeiel, with instruments of harps and lyres, and Asaph with cymbals was playing,
\p 
\v 6 and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets regularly, before the face of the Box of the covenant of God.
\p 
\v 7 On that day then David first appointed to thank Yahweh by the hand of Asaph and his brothers.
\p 
\v 8 Give thanks to Yahweh, call on his name; make known among the peoples his deeds.
\p 
\v 9 Sing to him, make music to him; tell of all his wonderful acts.
\p 
\v 10 Glory in his holy name; let the heart of those who seek Yahweh rejoice.
\p 
\v 11 Seek Yahweh and his strength; seek his face continually.
\p 
\v 12 Remember his wonderful acts which he has done, his miracles and the judgments of his mouth,
\p 
\v 13 O seed of Israel his servant, O sons of Jacob, his chosen ones.
\p 
\v 14 He is Yahweh, our God; in all the earth are his judgments.
\p 
\v 15 Remember forever his covenant, the word he commanded for 1,000 generations,
\p 
\v 16 which he cut with Abraham, and his oath to Isaac.
\p 
\v 17 And he established it for Jacob as a statute, for Israel a covenant forever,
\p 
\v 18 saying, “To you I will give the land of Canaan the allotment of your inheritance.”
\p 
\v 19 When you all were few in number, insignificant, and sojourners in it,
\p 
\v 20 and they walked back and forth from nation to nation, and from a kingdom to another people,
\p 
\v 21 he did not permit a person to oppress them; and he rebuked kings on account of them.
\p 
\v 22 “Do not strike my anointed ones, and against my prophets do not do evil.”
\p 
\v 23 Sing to Yahweh, all the earth; announce from day to day his salvation.
\p 
\v 24 Recount among the nations his glory, among all the peoples his wonderful acts.
\p 
\v 25 For great is Yahweh and to be praised much, and to be feared is he above all gods.
\p 
\v 26 For all the gods of the peoples are worthless, but Yahweh, the heavens he made.
\p 
\v 27 Splendor and majesty are before his face; strength and joy in his place.
\p 
\v 28 Ascribe to Yahweh, O clans of peoples, ascribe to Yahweh glory and strength!
\p 
\v 29 Ascribe to Yahweh the glory of his name; bring an offering and come before his face; worship Yahweh in holy splendor.
\p 
\v 30 Tremble from before his face, all the earth. Indeed, the world is established; it cannot be shaken.
\p 
\v 31 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth shout in exultation; and let them say among the nations, “Yahweh reigns.”
\p 
\v 32 Let the sea roar and that which fills it. Let the field exult, and all that is in it.
\p 
\v 33 Then the trees of the forest will shout for joy from before the face of Yahweh, for he is coming to judge the earth.
\p 
\v 34 Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good, for forever is his loyal love.
\p 
\v 35 And say, “Save us, God of our salvation, and gather us and deliver us from the nations, to give thanks to your holy name, to boast in your praise.”
\p 
\v 36 Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, from everlasting and as far as everlasting. And all the people said, “Amen” and praised Yahweh.
\p 
\v 37 And he left there before the face of the Box of the covenant of Yahweh Asaph and his brothers to minister before the face of the Box continually, according to the matter of the day in its day,
\p 
\v 38 and Obed Edom and their brothers, 68, and Obed Edom the son of Jeduthun, and Hosah, were gatekeepers,
\p 
\v 39 and Zadok the priest and his brothers the priests before the face of the tabernacle of Yahweh at the high place which was in Gibeon
\p 
\v 40 to bring up burnt offerings to Yahweh on the altar of burnt offering continually morning and evening, even according to all that is written in the law of Yahweh, which he commanded to Israel.
\p 
\v 41 And with them, Heman and Jeduthun and the rest of those chosen who were marked by names to give thanks to Yahweh, for forever is his loyal love.
\p 
\v 42 And with them, Heman and Jeduthun for those playing trumpets and cymbals and the instruments of song of God; and the sons of Jeduthun for the gate.
\p 
\v 43 And all the people went, each to his house, and David turned around to bless his house.
\c 17
\p 
\v 1 And it happened when David was living in his house, and David said to Nathan the prophet, “Behold, I am living in a house of cedars, but the Box of the covenant of Yahweh is under curtains.”
\p 
\v 2 And Nathan said to David, “All which is in your heart, do, for God is with you.”
\p 
\v 3 And it happened in that night, and the word of God came to Nathan, saying,
\p 
\v 4 “Go and say to David my servant, ‘Thus says Yahweh: You yourself shall not build for me a house in which to live,
\p 
\v 5 for I have not lived in a house from the day that I brought up Israel until this day, but I have been from tent to tent, and from a tabernacle.
\p 
\v 6 In all where I have walked back and forth among all Israel, what word did I speak to one of the judges of Israel whom I commanded to shepherd my people, saying, “Why have you all not built for me a house of cedars?”’
\p 
\v 7 And now, thus you shall say to my servant, to David, ‘Thus says Yahweh of Hosts: I myself took you from the pasture, from behind sheep, to be a leader over my people Israel.
\p 
\v 8 And I have been with you in all where you have gone, and I have cut off all your enemies from before your face, and I will make for you a name, like a name of the great ones who are on the earth.
\p 
\v 9 And I will set a place for my people Israel, and I will plant them, and they will settle on it, and they will not tremble again. And the sons of injustice will not continue to trouble them, just as at the first,
\p 
\v 10 and from the days that I commanded judges over my people Israel. And I will humble all your enemies. And I declare to you that a house Yahweh will build for you.
\p 
\v 11 And it will be when your days are fulfilled, to walk with your fathers, then I will raise up your seed after you who will be from your sons, and I will establish his kingdom.
\p 
\v 12 He himself will build for me a house, and I will establish his throne as far as forever.
\p 
\v 13 I myself will be to him a father, and he himself will be to me a son. And my covenant faithfulness I will not take away from with him, as I took away from who was before your face.
\p 
\v 14 And I will set him up in my house and in my kingdom as far as forever, and his throne will be established as far as forever.’”
\p 
\v 15 According to all these words and according to all this vision, thus Nathan spoke to David.
\p 
\v 16 Then the king David went in and sat before the face of Yahweh; and he said, “Who am I, Yahweh God, and what is my house, that you have brought me as far as here?
\p 
\v 17 And a small thing was this in your eyes, God, and you have spoken regarding the house of your servant from a distance; and you have seen me as an appearance of the man moving upwards, Yahweh God.
\p 
\v 18 What more can David still say to you about honoring your servant. And you, your servant you know.
\p 
\v 19 Yahweh, for the sake of your servant and according to your heart, you have done all this greatness to make known all the greatnesses.
\p 
\v 20 Yahweh, there is none like you, and no God except you, in all which we have heard with our ears.
\p 
\v 21 And who is like your people Israel, one nation on the earth whom God went to ransom for himself a people, to set for you a name great and to be feared, to drive out nations from the faces of your people whom you ransomed from Egypt?
\p 
\v 22 And you made your people Israel for yourself a people as far as forever, and you, Yahweh, became to them God.
\p 
\v 23 And now, Yahweh, the word which you spoke concerning your servant and concerning his house, may it be confirmed as far as forever, and do just as you have spoken.
\p 
\v 24 And may it be confirmed and may your name be great as far as forever, saying, ‘Yahweh of Hosts, the God of Israel, is God to Israel,’ and the house of David your servant established before your face.
\p 
\v 25 For you, my God, have uncovered the ear of your servant to build for him a house; therefore your servant has found to pray before your face.
\p 
\v 26 And now, Yahweh, you are God, and you have spoken concerning your servant this good.
\p 
\v 27 And now, you have decided to bless the house of your servant, to be forever before your face. For you, Yahweh, have blessed, and it is blessed forever.”
\c 18
\p 
\v 1 And it happened after this that David struck down the Philistines, and he humbled them. And he took Gath and its daughters from the hand of the Philistines.
\p 
\v 2 And he struck down Moab, and the Moabites became servants to David, carriers of tribute.
\p 
\v 3 And David struck down Hadadezer, the king of Zobah Hamath, when he went to set up his hand at the Euphrates River.
\p 
\v 4 And David captured from him 1,000 chariots, and 7,000 horsemen, and 20,000 men on foot. And David hamstrung all the chariots, but spared from him 100 chariots.
\p 
\v 5 And Aram of Damascus came to help Hadadezer the king of Zobah, and David struck down of the Arameans 22,000 men.
\p 
\v 6 And David set up in Aram of Damascus, and Aram became servants to David, carriers of tribute. And Yahweh saved David in all where he went.
\p 
\v 7 And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and he brought them to Jerusalem.
\p 
\v 8 And from Tibhath and from Kun, cities of Hadadezer, David took very much bronze. With it, Solomon made the sea of bronze and the pillars and bronze items.
\p 
\v 9 And Tou, the king of Hamath, heard that David struck down all the army of Hadadezer, the king of Zobah.
\p 
\v 10 And he sent Hadoram his son to King David to ask him for peace and to bless him because he had fought against Hadadezer and struck him down, for a man of war Tou was with Hadadezer, and all the items of gold and silver and bronze.
\p 
\v 11 Also these King David consecrated to Yahweh with the silver and the gold that he carried away from all the nations: from Edom, and from Moab, and from the sons of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek.
\p 
\v 12 And Abishai the son of Zeruiah struck down Edom in the Valley of Salt, 18,000.
\p 
\v 13 And he set in Edom garrisons, and all Edom became servants to David. And Yahweh saved David in all where he went.
\p 
\v 14 And David reigned over all Israel. And it happened he was doing judgment and righteousness for all his people.
\p 
\v 15 And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army, and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, secretary.
\p 
\v 16 And Zadok the son of Ahitub and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, priests, and Shavsha, scribe.
\p 
\v 17 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Kerethites and the Pelethites, and the sons of David, the heads at the hand of the king.
\c 19
\p 
\v 1 And it happened after this, and Nahash, the king of the sons of Ammon, died, and his son reigned in his place.
\p 
\v 2 And David said, “I will do loyal kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father did to me loyal kindness.” And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. And the servants of David came to the land of the sons of Ammon, to Hanun, to comfort him.
\p 
\v 3 And the chiefs of the sons of Ammon said to Hanun, “Is David honoring your father in your eyes because he sent to you comforters? Is it not for the sake of to explore and to overthrow and to spy the land his servants came to you?”
\p 
\v 4 And Hanun took the servants of David, and he shaved them, and he cut their garments in half, until the buttocks, and he sent them away.
\p 
\v 5 And they went, and they declared to David concerning the men. And he sent to meet them for the men were greatly humiliated. And the king said, “Stay in Jericho until when your beards grow, then return.”
\p 
\v 6 And the sons of Ammon saw that they were a stench to David, and Hanun sent, and the sons of Ammon, 1,000 talents of silver to hire for themselves from Aram Naharaim, and from Aram Maacah, and from Zobah, chariots and horsemen.
\p 
\v 7 And they hired for themselves 32,000 chariots and the king of Maacah and his people. And they came, and they encamped before the face of Medeba. And the sons of Ammon assembled from their cities, and came to battle.
\p 
\v 8 And David heard, and he sent Joab and all the army of mighty ones.
\p 
\v 9 And the sons of Ammon came out, and they arrayed for battle at the entrance of the city. And the kings who came were by themselves in the field.
\p 
\v 10 And Joab saw that the face of the battle was to him faces and hindquarter, and he chose from all the choice ones among Israel, and he arrayed to meet Aram.
\p 
\v 11 And the remainder of the people he placed in the hand of Abishai his brother, and they arrayed to meet the sons of Ammon.
\p 
\v 12 And he said, “If Aram is too strong for me, then you shall be to me for salvation. And if the sons of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will save you.
\p 
\v 13 Be strong, and let us strengthen ourselves on behalf of our people and on behalf of the cities of our God, and Yahweh, the good in his eyes, he will do.”
\p 
\v 14 And Joab drew near, and the people who were with him, before the faces of Aram for battle. And they fled from his face.
\p 
\v 15 And the sons of Ammon saw that Aram fled, and these also fled from the face of Abishai his brother. And they came to the city and Joab came to Jerusalem.
\p 
\v 16 And Aram saw that they were defeated before the face of Israel. And they sent messengers, and they brought out Aram, who was beyond the river, and Shophak the chief of the army of Hadadezer before their faces.
\p 
\v 17 And it was told to David, and he gathered all Israel. And he passed over the Jordan, and he came to them. And he arrayed against them. And David arrayed to meet Aram for battle, and they fought with him.
\p 
\v 18 And Aram fled from before the face of Israel, and David killed from Aram 7,000 chariots and 40,000 men on foot. And Shophak the chief of the army, he killed.
\p 
\v 19 And the servants of Hadadezer saw that they were defeated before the face of Israel, and they made peace with David, and they served him. And Aram was not willing to save the sons of Ammon again.
\c 20
\p 
\v 1 And it happened at the time of the turning of the year, at the time of the going out of kings, that Joab led out the army for war and he devastated the land of the sons of Ammon. And he came, and he besieged Rabbah. And David stayed in Jerusalem. And Joab struck down Rabbah, and he tore it down.
\p 
\v 2 And David took the crown of their king from on his head, and he found the weight was a talent of gold, and in it was a precious stone. And it was on the head of David, and the plunder of the city he brought out, a very great amount.
\p 
\v 3 And the people who were in it, he brought out, and they sawed with saws and with sharp instruments of iron and with saws. And thus David did to all the cities of the sons of Ammon. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.
\p 
\v 4 And it happened after this that war arose at Gezer with the Philistines. Then Sibbekai the Hushathite struck down Sippai, from the descendants of the Rephaim, and they were humbled.
\p 
\v 5 And there was again war with the Philistines, and Elhanan the son of Jair struck down Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite; and the wood of his spear was like a beam of a weaver.
\p 
\v 6 And there was again war in Gath. And there was a man of stature. And his digits were six and six, 24, and he also was born of Rapha.
\p 
\v 7 And he taunted Israel. And Jonathan the son of Shimea, the brother of David, struck him down.
\p 
\v 8 These were born to Rapha in Gath, and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants.
\c 21
\p 
\v 1 And an adversary stood against Israel, and he incited David to count Israel.
\p 
\v 2 And David said to Joab and to the chiefs of the people, “Go, count Israel from Beersheba and as far as Dan, and bring to me, that I may know their number.”
\p 
\v 3 And Joab said, “May Yahweh add to his people like them 100 times. Are not, my lord the king, all of them servants to my lord? Why does my lord seek this? Why should it be guilt for Israel?”
\p 
\v 4 But the word of the king was strong against Joab. So Joab went out and walked back and forth in all Israel. Then he came to Jerusalem.
\p 
\v 5 And Joab gave the number of the numbering of the people to David. And all Israel was 1,100,000 men who drew the sword, and Judah, 470,000 men who drew the sword.
\p 
\v 6 But Levi and Benjamin he did not number in their midst, for the word of the king was abhorrent to Joab.
\p 
\v 7 And it was evil in the eyes of God concerning this word, and he struck Israel.
\p 
\v 8 And David said to God, “I have sinned greatly in that I have done this thing. And now please cause to pass the iniquity of your servant, for I have acted very foolishly.”
\p 
\v 9 And Yahweh spoke to Gad, the seer of David, saying,
\p 
\v 10 “Go and speak to David, saying, ‘Thus says Yahweh, three I am stretching over you; choose for yourself one from them, and I will act towards you.’”
\p 
\v 11 And Gad came to David, and he said to him, “Thus says Yahweh, ‘Take for yourself:
\p 
\v 12 either three years famine, or three months being swept away from the faces of your foes and overtaken by the sword of your enemies, or three days of the sword of Yahweh, even pestilence in the land and the angel of Yahweh destroying in all the territory of Israel.’ And now, see; what word shall I bring back to the one who sent me?”
\p 
\v 13 And David said to Gad, “There is great distress to me! Please let me fall into the hand of Yahweh, for many are his great mercies, but into the hand of man, do not let me fall.”
\p 
\v 14 And Yahweh gave a pestilence on Israel, and from Israel fell 70,000 men.
\p 
\v 15 And God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy her. And when destroying, Yahweh saw, and he relented concerning the disaster. And he said to the angel who was destroying, “Enough! Now release your hand.” And the angel of Yahweh was standing at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
\p 
\v 16 And David lifted his eyes and saw the angel of Yahweh standing between the earth and between the heavens and his sword drawn in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. And David fell, and the elders, covered in sackcloth, on their faces.
\p 
\v 17 And David said to God, “Was it not I myself who said to count the people? And it is I who sinned, and I have surely done evil, but these sheep, what have they done? Yahweh my God, please let your hand be against me and against the house of my father, but not on your people a plague.”
\p 
\v 18 And the angel of Yahweh said to Gad to say to David that David should go up to raise an altar to Yahweh at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
\p 
\v 19 So David went up at the word of Gad who spoke in the name of Yahweh.
\p 
\v 20 And Ornan turned, and he saw the angel. And four of his sons with him were hiding themselves. And Ornan was threshing wheat.
\p 
\v 21 And David came to Ornan. And Ornan looked, and he saw David. And he went out from the threshing floor, and he bowed down to David, face to the ground.
\p 
\v 22 And David said to Ornan, “Give to me the place of the threshing floor, and I will build on it an altar to Yahweh. At the full price give it to me, so the plague may be restrained from against the people.”
\p 
\v 23 And Ornan said to David, “Take for yourself that my lord the king may do good in his eyes. See, I give the cattle for the burnt offerings and the threshing sledges for wood, and the wheat for the offering; all I give.”
\p 
\v 24 And King David said to Ornan, “No, for I will surely buy at the full price, for I will not lift up what is yours to Yahweh and offer a burnt offering without paying compensation.”
\p 
\v 25 And David gave to Ornan for the place 600 shekels of gold by weight.
\p 
\v 26 And David built there an altar to Yahweh and he offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. And he called to Yahweh, and he answered him with fire from the heavens on the altar of the burnt offering.
\p 
\v 27 And Yahweh spoke to the angel, and he returned his sword to its sheath.
\p 
\v 28 At that time, when David saw that Yahweh had answered him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.
\p 
\v 29 And the tabernacle of Yahweh which Moses made in the wilderness and the altar of the burnt offering at that time were at the high place at Gibeon.
\p 
\v 30 And David was not able to go to its face to seek God, for he was terrified from the faces of the sword of the angel of Yahweh.
\c 22
\p 
\v 1 And David said, “This is the house of Yahweh God, and this is the altar for the burnt offering of Israel.”
\p 
\v 2 And David said to gather the foreigners who were in the land of Israel. And he assigned stonemasons to hew out cut stones to build the house of God.
\p 
\v 3 And a large amount of iron for the nails for the doors of the gates and for braces, David prepared; and a large amount of bronze, there is no weighing.
\p 
\v 4 And trees of cedar without number, for the Sidonians and the Tyrians brought a large amount of cedar trees to David.
\p 
\v 5 And David said, “Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house to be built for Yahweh must be great for the sake of a name and for beauty in all the lands. I will now prepare for it.” And David prepared a large amount before the face of his death.
\p 
\v 6 And he called for Solomon his son, and he commanded him to build a house for Yahweh, the God of Israel.
\p 
\v 7 And David said to Solomon, “My son, it was with my heart to build a house myself for the name of Yahweh my God.
\p 
\v 8 But the word of Yahweh was to me, saying, ‘A large amount of blood you have shed and great wars you have made; you shall not build a house for my name because a large amount of blood you have shed on the ground before my face.
\p 
\v 9 Behold, a son is being born to you; he himself will be a man of rest. And I will give rest to him from all his enemies from all around. For Solomon will be his name, and peace and quietness I will give to Israel in his days.
\p 
\v 10 He himself will build a house for my name. And he himself will be to me a son, and I to him a father. And I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel as far as forever.’
\p 
\v 11 Now, my son, may Yahweh be with you, and may you be successful and build a house of Yahweh your God, just as he spoke concerning you.
\p 
\v 12 Only may Yahweh give to you insight and understanding, and give you charge over Israel so that you may keep the law of Yahweh your God.
\p 
\v 13 Then you will succeed, if you are careful to do the statutes and the judgments which Yahweh commanded Moses concerning Israel. Be strong and courageous. Do not fear and do not be dismayed.
\p 
\v 14 Now, see, in my affliction, I have prepared for the house of Yahweh gold talents, 100,000, and silver, 1,000,000 talents, and for bronze and for iron, there is no weighing, for there is a large amount. And trees and stones I have prepared. And to them you will add.
\p 
\v 15 And with you is a large amount of doers of work: stonemasons, and craftsmen of stone and wood, and all wise in all work,
\p 
\v 16 for gold, for silver, and for bronze, and for iron; there is no numbering. Arise and work. And may Yahweh be with you.”
\p 
\v 17 And David commanded all the chiefs of Israel to help Solomon his son,
\p 
\v 18 “Is not Yahweh your God with you all and given rest to you all from all around? For he has given into my hand the inhabitants of the land, and the land is subdued before the face of Yahweh and before the faces of his people.
\p 
\v 19 Now, give your heart and your life to seek Yahweh your God, and arise and build the sanctuary of Yahweh God to bring the Box of the covenant of Yahweh and the sacred items of God to the house to be built for the name of Yahweh.”
\c 23
\p 
\v 1 And David was old and was full of days, and he made Solomon his son king over Israel.
\p 
\v 2 And he gathered all the chiefs of Israel and the priests and the Levites.
\p 
\v 3 And the Levites were counted from sons of 30 years and upward and the numbering was by their heads, by males, 38, 000.
\p 
\v 4 “From these, to lead the work of the house of Yahweh, 24,000, and officers and judges, 6,000,
\p 
\v 5 and 4,000 gatekeepers and 4,000 praisers to Yahweh with the instruments which I made to praise.”
\p 
\v 6 And David divided them into divisions according to the sons of Levi: of Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
\p 
\v 7 Of the Gershonites: Ladan and Shimei.
\p 
\v 8 The sons of Ladan: the head Jehiel, and Zetham, and Joel, three.
\p 
\v 9 The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These, the heads of the fathers of Ladan.
\p 
\v 10 And the sons of Shimei: Jahath, and Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. These, the sons of Shimei, four.
\p 
\v 11 And Jahath was the head, and Zizah the second, but Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons, and they were to a house of a father for one group.
\p 
\v 12 The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.
\p 
\v 13 The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses. And Aaron was set apart for him to consecrate the most holy things, he and his sons until forever, to make sacrifices before the face of Yahweh to minister for him and to bless in his name until forever.
\p 
\v 14 And Moses, the man of God, his sons were called according to the tribe of Levi.
\p 
\v 15 The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer.
\p 
\v 16 The sons of Gershom: Shebuel the head.
\p 
\v 17 And the sons of Eliezer were Rehabiah the head, and there were not to Eliezer other sons, but the sons of Rehabiah were many above that.
\p 
\v 18 The sons of Izhar: Shelomith the head.
\p 
\v 19 The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the head, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.
\p 
\v 20 The sons of Uzziel: Micah the head, and Isshiah the second.
\p 
\v 21 The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish.
\p 
\v 22 And Eleazar died and there were not to him sons, but only daughters. And the sons of Kish, their brothers, lifted them.
\p 
\v 23 The sons of Mushi: Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth, three.
\p 
\v 24 These were the sons of Levi according to the house of their fathers, heads of the fathers, by their appointments, in the numbering of names by their heads, the doer of the work of the service of the house of Yahweh; from the sons of 20 years and upward.
\p 
\v 25 For David said, “Yahweh, the God of Israel, has given rest to his people. And he dwells in Jerusalem until forever.
\p 
\v 26 And also, for the Levites, no longer to carry the tabernacle and all its items for its service.”
\p 
\v 27 For by the last words of David, they were numbering the sons of Levi, from the sons of 20 years and upward.
\p 
\v 28 For their office was by the hand of the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of Yahweh over the courts, and over the chambers, and over the cleansing of all the sacred things, and the work of the service of the house of God.
\p 
\v 29 And concerning the bread of the arrangement, and concerning the fine flour for the offering, and concerning the wafers of the unleavened bread, and concerning the pan, and concerning that which is mixed, and concerning all measure and size.
\p 
\v 30 And to stand morning by morning to thank and to praise Yahweh, and thus in the evening.
\p 
\v 31 And concerning to offer all the burnt offerings to Yahweh for the Sabbaths, for the new moons, and for the appointed times in the numbering according to the judgment over them regularly before the face of Yahweh.
\p 
\v 32 And they were to keep the charge of the tent of meeting and the charge of the holy place, and the charge of the sons of Aaron their brothers for the service of the house of Yahweh.
\c 24
\p 
\v 1 And to the sons of Aaron, their division. The sons of Aaron: Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
\p 
\v 2 And Nadab died, as well as Abihu, before the face of their father, and sons were not to them. And Eleazar and Ithamar became priests.
\p 
\v 3 And David divided them, along with Zadok from the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech from the sons of Ithamar, according to their office in their service.
\p 
\v 4 And more sons of Eleazar were found for heads of men than the sons of Ithamar, and they divided them for the sons of Eleazar, heads of a house of the fathers, 16, and for the sons of Ithamar for the house of their fathers, eight.
\p 
\v 5 And they divided them by lots, these with these, for there were sacred chiefs and chiefs of God from the sons of Eleazar and in the sons of Ithamar.
\p 
\v 6 And Shemaiah the son of Nethanel the scribe from the Levites wrote them before the face of the king, and the chiefs, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and the heads of the fathers for the priests and for the Levites. One house of a father was picked for Eleazar, and one was picked for Ithamar.
\p 
\v 7 And the first lot went to Jehoiarib, to Jedaiah the second,
\p 
\v 8 to Harim the third, to Seorim the fourth,
\p 
\v 9 to Malkijah the fifth, to Mijamin the sixth,
\p 
\v 10 to Hakkoz the seventh, to Abijah the eighth,
\p 
\v 11 to Jeshua the ninth, to Shecaniah the tenth,
\p 
\v 12 to Eliashib the 11th, to Jakim the 12th,
\p 
\v 13 to Huppah the 13th, to Jeshebeab the 14th,
\p 
\v 14 to Bilgah the 15th, to Immer the 16th,
\p 
\v 15 to Hezir the 17th, to Happizzez the 18th,
\p 
\v 16 to Pethahiah the 19th, to Jehezkel the 20th,
\p 
\v 17 to Jakin the 21st, to Gamul the 22nd,
\p 
\v 18 to Delaiah the 23rd, to Maaziah the 24th.
\p 
\v 19 These, their office for their service to come into the house of Yahweh, according to the judgments by the hand of Aaron their father, just as Yahweh the God of Israel commanded him.
\p 
\v 20 And to the sons of Levi, the ones who are left, of the sons of Amram, Shubael; of the sons of Shubael, Jehdeiah.
\p 
\v 21 To Rehabiah, of the sons of Rehabiah, the head Ishijah.
\p 
\v 22 To the Izharites, Shelomoth, of the sons of Shelomoth, Jahath.
\p 
\v 23 And the sons of Jeriah, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.
\p 
\v 24 The sons of Uzziel, Micah, of the sons of Micah, Shamir.
\p 
\v 25 The brother of Micah, Ishijah, of the sons of Ishijah, Zechariah.
\p 
\v 26 The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Jaaziah: Beno.
\p 
\v 27 The sons of Merari, of Jaaziah: Beno, and Shoham, and Zaccur, and Ibri.
\p 
\v 28 To Mahli, Eleazar, and not were to him sons.
\p 
\v 29 To Kish, the sons of Kish, Jerahmeel.
\p

\p 
\v 2 And David the king rose to his feet, and he said, “Hear me, my brothers and my people, I had in my heart to build a house of rest for the Box of the covenant of Yahweh and for the footstool of the feet of our God. And I have prepared to build.
\p 
\v 3 But God said to me, ‘You will not build a house for my name, because a man of war you are and blood you have shed.’
\p 
\v 4 Yet Yahweh, the God of Israel, chose me from all of the house of my father to be king over Israel forever, for among Judah he chose for a leader, and in the house of Judah, the house of my father, and among the sons of my father, with me he was pleased to make king over all Israel.
\p 
\v 5 And from all my sons, for many sons Yahweh has given to me, and he chose Solomon my son to sit on the throne of the kingdom of Yahweh over Israel.
\p 
\v 6 And he said to me, ‘Solomon your son, he himself will build my house and my courts, for I have chosen him for myself for a son, and I myself will be to him for a father.
\p 
\v 7 And I will establish his kingdom until forever, if he is strong to do my commands and my judgments, like this day.’
\p 
\v 8 And now, in the eyes of all Israel, the assembly of Yahweh, and in the ears of our God, keep and seek all the commands of Yahweh your God in order that you all will possess the good land and you all will cause your sons after you to inherit until forever.
\p 
\v 9 And you, Solomon my son, know the God of your father, and serve him with a whole heart and with a willing life, for all hearts Yahweh seeks and all purpose of thoughts understands. If you seek him, he will be found by you, but if you abandon him, he will reject you forever.
\p 
\v 10 See, now, that Yahweh has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary. Be strong and act.”
\p 
\v 11 And David gave to Solomon his son the plan of the porch, and its houses, and its treasuries, and its upper rooms, and its inner rooms, and the house of the atonement lid,
\p 
\v 12 and the plan of all that was by the Spirit with him for the courts of the house of Yahweh, and for all the chambers all around, for the treasuries of the house of God and for the treasuries of the sacred things,
\p 
\v 13 and for the divisions of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of Yahweh, and for all the items of the service of the house of Yahweh,
\p 
\v 14 for gold by weight, for gold for all the items of service and service, for all the items of silver by weight, for all the items of service and service,
\p 
\v 15 and the weight for the gold lampstands and their gold lamps by weight of lampstand and lampstand and its lamps, and for the lampstands of silver by weight for the lampstand and its lamps, according to the service of lampstand and lampstand,
\p 
\v 16 and the gold weight for the tables of the arrangement, for the table and table, and silver for the tables of silver,
\p 
\v 17 and the forks and the bowls and the jugs of pure gold and for the basins of gold by weight for basin and basin, and for the basins of silver by weight, for basin and basin,
\p 
\v 18 and for the altar of incense, refined gold by weight, and for the plan of the chariot of the cherubim, gold, that spread out and cover over the Box of the covenant of Yahweh.
\p 
\v 19 The entirety in writing from the hand of Yahweh upon me, he instructed all of the works of the plan.”
\p 
\v 20 And David said to Solomon his son, “Be strong and be courageous and act. Do not fear and do not be dismayed for Yahweh God, my God, is with you. He will not leave you and he will not abandon you until all the work of the service of the house of Yahweh is finished.
\p 
\v 21 And behold, the divisions of the priests and the Levites for all the service of the house of God, and with you in all the work will be every willing one with wisdom, for all the service, and the chiefs and all the people for all your ways.”
\c 29
\p 
\v 1 And King David said to all the assembly, “Solomon my son, alone God has chosen him, is young and tender, and the work is great; for not for man is the palace but for Yahweh God.
\p 
\v 2 And according to all my power I have provided for the house of my God, the gold for the gold, and the silver for the silver, and the bronze for the bronze, the iron for the iron, and the wood for the wood, stones of onyx and settings, stones of antimony and colorful things, and all the rare stones and alabaster stones, in abundance.
\p 
\v 3 And again, in my delighting in the house of my God, possessions belonging to me, gold and silver, I give to the house of my God, above all I have prepared for the sacred house:
\p 
\v 4 3,000 talents of gold from the gold of Ophir, and 7,000 talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses,
\p 
\v 5 gold for gold, and silver for silver, and for all the work by the hand of the craftsmen. And who offers freely to fill his hand today to Yahweh?”
\p 
\v 6 And the chiefs of the fathers offered freely as well as the chiefs of the tribes of Israel and the chiefs of thousands and hundreds, and the chiefs of the work of the king.
\p 
\v 7 And they gave for the service of the house of God gold, 5,000 talents and 10,000 darics, and silver, 10,000 talents, and bronze, 18,000 talents, and iron, 100,000 talents.
\p 
\v 8 And he who was found with it, stones, they gave to the treasury of the house of Yahweh, under the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.
\p 
\v 9 And the people rejoiced because they offered freely, for with a whole heart they offered freely to Yahweh. And also King David rejoiced with great joy.
\p 
\v 10 And David blessed Yahweh in the eyes of all the assembly. And David said, “Blessed are you, Yahweh, God of Israel, our father, from forever and until forever.
\p 
\v 11 To you, Yahweh, the greatness, and the might, and the beauty, and the splendor, and the majesty; indeed, everything in the heavens and in the earth. To you, Yahweh, the kingdom and lifting yourself above all as head.
\p 
\v 12 And the riches and the glory from before your face, and you are ruling over all, and in your hand power and might, and in your hand to make great and to strengthen all.
\p 
\v 13 And now, our God, we are giving thanks to you and praising the name of your beauty.
\p 
\v 14 But who am I, and who are my people, that we should retain power to offer freely like this? For from you is everything, and from your hand we have given to you.
\p 
\v 15 For we are foreigners before your face and sojourners, like all our fathers, like the shadow are our days on the earth, and there is no hope.
\p 
\v 16 Yahweh our God, all this abundance that we have prepared in order to build for you a house for the name of your holiness, from your hand it is and for you is all.
\p 
\v 17 And I know, my God, that you examine the heart and in uprightness are pleased. I, in the uprightness of my heart, I have offered freely all these, and now your people are found here, I see with joy, to offer freely to you.
\p 
\v 18 Yahweh, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel—our fathers—keep this forever concerning the purpose of the thoughts of the heart of your people, and direct their hearts to you.
\p 
\v 19 And to Solomon my son, give a whole heart to keep your commandments, your testimonies, and your statutes, and to do all and to build the palace for which I have prepared.”
\p 
\v 20 And David said to all the assembly, “Bless Yahweh your God.” And all the assembly blessed Yahweh, the God of their fathers. And they bowed down and paid homage to Yahweh and to the king.
\p 
\v 21 And they sacrificed to Yahweh sacrifices, and they offered burnt offerings to Yahweh on the day following that day, 1,000 bulls, 1,000 rams, 1,000 lambs, and their drink offerings and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel.
\p 
\v 22 And they ate and drank before the face of Yahweh that day with great joy. And they made king a second time Solomon, the son of David, and they anointed for Yahweh for a leader and Zadok for priest.
\p 
\v 23 And Solomon sat on the throne of Yahweh as king instead of David his father, and he succeeded. And all Israel listened to him.
\p 
\v 24 And all the chiefs, and the mighty ones, and also all the sons of King David gave a hand under King Solomon.
\p 
\v 25 And Yahweh made Solomon exceedingly great in the eyes of all Israel. And he bestowed on him majesty of a kingdom which has not been on any king before his face over Israel.
\p 
\v 26 And David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.
\p 
\v 27 And the days which he reigned over Israel, 40 years. In Hebron he reigned seven years, and in Jerusalem he reigned 33.
\p 
\v 28 And he died at a good old age, full of days, riches, and glory. And Solomon his son reigned in his place.
\p 
\v 29 And the matters of King David, the first things and the last things, behold, they are written in the words of Samuel the Seer, and in the words of Nathan the prophet, and in the words of Gad the prophet,
\p 
\v 30 with all his reign and his might and the times which passed over on him, and on Israel, and on all the kingdoms of the lands.
