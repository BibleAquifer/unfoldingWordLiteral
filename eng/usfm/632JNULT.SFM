\p 
\v 1 The elder, to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in truth—and not only I, but also all the ones having known the truth—
\p 
\v 2 because of the truth that remains in us and will be with us to eternity.
\p 
\v 3 Grace, mercy, {and} peace will be with us from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.
\p 
\v 4 I rejoiced greatly that I found some of your children walking in truth, just as we have received a commandment from the Father.
\p 
\v 5 And now I ask you, lady—not as writing a new commandment to you, but what we have had from the beginning—that we should love one another.
\p 
\v 6 And this is that love, that we should walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, just as you heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it.
\p 
\v 7 For many deceivers have gone out into the world, the ones not confessing Jesus Christ coming in flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist.
\p 
\v 8 Watch yourselves, that you do not lose what we have worked for, but may receive a full reward.
\p 
\v 9 Everyone going beyond and not remaining in the teaching of Christ does not have God. The one remaining in the teaching, this one has both the Father and the Son.
\p 
\v 10 If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house and do not say to him, “Greetings.”
\p 
\v 11 For the one saying to him, “Greetings,” shares in his evil deeds.
\p 
\v 12 Having much to write to you, I did not want with paper and ink. However, I hope to come to you and to speak mouth to mouth, so that your joy might be made complete.
\p 
\v 13 The children of your chosen sister greet you.
