34and the cloud of Yahweh was over them by day when they set out from the camp.

## Numbers 11:2 (id: 904011002)

2And the people cried out to Moses, and Moses prayed to Yahweh and the fire sank;


## Numbers 11:3 (id: 904011003)

3and the name of that place was called Taberah, for the fire of Yahweh burned among them.


## Numbers 11:4 (id: 904011004)

5We remember the fish that we ate in Egypt for nothing, the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic.

## Numbers 11:8 (id: 904011008)

8The people went around and picked up and ground with the handmill or crushed with the mortar and boiled in the pot and made it cakes, and its taste was like the taste of the delicacy of the oil,

11And Moses said to Yahweh, “Why do you do evil to your servant? And why have I not found favor in your eyes, by putting the burden of all this people on me?


## Numbers 11:12 (id: 904011012)

12Did I conceive all of this people? Did I give birth to him so that you could say to me, ‘Carry him in your bosom just as the one who nourishes carries the one who sucks over the ground that you have sworn to his fathers?’


## Numbers 11:13 (id: 904011013)

13From where is meat for me to give to all of this people? For they weep beside me, saying, ‘Give to us meat and let us eat.’


## Numbers 11:14 (id: 904011014)

14I am not able by myself to carry all of this people, for they are heavier than me.

15And if you are going to do thus to me, please slay me quickly, if I have found favor in your eyes, and do not let me look on my evil.”

## Numbers 11:18 (id: 904011018)

18And to the people you shall say, ‘Make yourselves holy for tomorrow, and you shall eat meat. For you have wept in the ears of Yahweh, saying, “Who will let us eat meat? For it was good for us in Egypt.” And Yahweh will give to you meat, and you will eat.


## Numbers 11:19 (id: 904011019)

19You will eat not one day and not two days and not five days and not ten days and not twenty days,


## Numbers 11:20 (id: 904011020)

20until a month of days, until when it goes out from your nose. And it shall be for disgust for you, because that you rejected Yahweh who is in the midst of you, and you wept before his face, saying, “Why this—we went out from Egypt?”’”


## Numbers 11:21 (id: 904011021)

21And Moses said, “The people are 600, 000 on foot who I am in the midst of, and you have said, ‘I shall give to them meat and they shall eat a month of days.’


## Numbers 11:22 (id: 904011022)

25And Yahweh came down in the cloud and he spoke to him, and he withdrew some of the spirit that was on him, and he put it on 70 men, the elders. And it happened when the spirit rested on them that they prophesied but did not again.


## Numbers 11:26 (id: 904011026)

26And two of the men were left in the camp: The name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the second was Medad. And the spirit rested on them, and they were among the written down ones, but they had not gone out to the tent; and they prophesied in the camp.


## Numbers 11:27 (id: 904011027)

27And the young man ran and reported to Moses, and he said, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.”

## Numbers 11:31 (id: 904011031)

31And a wind set out from with Yahweh, and it brought over quail from the sea, and it left on the camp like a road of a day here and like a road of a day here, round about the camp, and like two cubits on the face of the land.


## Numbers 11:32 (id: 904011032)

32And the people rose all that day and all the night and all the day of the next day, and they gathered the quail. The one who did little gathered ten homers. And they spread out for them, spreading out round about the camp.


## Numbers 11:33 (id: 904011033)

33The meat was still between their teeth–before it was chewed–and the nose of Yahweh burned against the people, and Yahweh struck the people an exceedingly great blow,


## Numbers 11:34 (id: 904011034)

34and he called the name of that place Kibroth Hattaavah, because there they buried the people who had desired.


## Numbers 11:35 (id: 904011035)

35From Kibroth Hattaavah the people set out to Hazeroth. Then they were in Hazeroth.

6And he said, “Hear now my words! If one is your prophet, I, Yahweh will make myself known to him in the vision. I will speak with him in the dream.


## Numbers 12:7 (id: 904012007)

7Not so my servant Moses; he is trustworthy in all my house.


## Numbers 12:8 (id: 904012008)

8I speak with him mouth to mouth, and with appearance, and not with riddles; and he looks at the form of Yahweh. And why are you not afraid to speak against my servant, against Moses?”


## Numbers 12:9 (id: 904012009)

9And the nose of Yahweh burned against them and he went,


## Numbers 12:10 (id: 904012010)

11and Aaron said to Moses, “Please, my master, please do not put on us sin which we did foolishly and which we sinned.

## Numbers 13:33 (id: 904013033)

33and there we saw the Nephilim, the sons of Anak from the Nephilim, and we were like grasshoppers in our eyes, and so we were in their eyes.”

12I will strike him down with the plague, and I will disinherit him, and I will make you into a nation greater and more numerous than them.”

13And Moses said to Yahweh, “And the Egyptians have heard that you brought this people up with your power from the midst of him.


## Numbers 14:14 (id: 904014014)

14And they have spoken to those dwelling in this land. They have heard that you, Yahweh, are in the midst of this people; that you, Yahweh, have been seen eye by eye, and your cloud is standing over them, and in a column of cloud you are going before their face by day and in a column of fire at night.


## Numbers 14:15 (id: 904014015)

15If you kill this people like one man, then the nations will say that they heard a report of you, saying,


## Numbers 14:16 (id: 904014016)

16‘Because Yahweh was not able to bring this people into the land that he swore to them, so he slaughtered them in the wilderness.’


## Numbers 14:17 (id: 904014017)

17And now, please let the power of my Lord be great, just as you have spoken, saying,


## Numbers 14:18 (id: 904014018)

18‘Yahweh is long of nostrils and abundant of covenant faithfulness, lifting up iniquity and transgression. But surely he will not leave unpunished, appointing the iniquity of fathers on sons, on thirds, and on fourths.’


## Numbers 14:19 (id: 904014019)

19Please forgive this people of the iniquity according to the greatness of your covenant faithfulness, and just as you have lifted up this people, from Egypt and to here.”


## Numbers 14:20 (id: 904014020)

20And Yahweh said, “I have forgiven according to your word.


## Numbers 14:21 (id: 904014021)

21But truly, I live, and all the earth will be filled with the glory of Yahweh.


## Numbers 14:22 (id: 904014022)

22For all the men who have seen my glory and my signs that I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and they tested me this ten times and have not listened to my voice,


## Numbers 14:23 (id: 904014023)

23if they see the land that I have sworn to their fathers…and all those who spurn me will not see it.


## Numbers 14:24 (id: 904014024)

24But my servant Caleb, because another spirit is with him, and he was fully after me, I will bring him into the land that he will come to there, and his seed will inherit it.


## Numbers 14:25 (id: 904014025)

25(And the Amalekite and the Canaanite were dwelling in the valley.) Tomorrow turn and set out for yourselves to the wilderness, the way of the Sea of Reeds.”

26And Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,


## Numbers 14:27 (id: 904014027)

27“Until when must I listen to this evil congregation, they who are murmuring against me the murmurings of the sons of Israel, they who are murmuring against me?


## Numbers 14:28 (id: 904014028)

28Say to them, ‘{As} I live,’–the declaration of Yahweh–‘surely just as you have spoken in my ears, so I will do to you:


## Numbers 14:29 (id: 904014029)

29In this wilderness your corpses will fall and all your counted ones according to all your number, from a son of 20 years and upward, who have murmured against me.


## Numbers 14:30 (id: 904014030)

30If you enter into the land that I have lifted up my hand to make you dwell in … except Caleb the son of Jephunneh and Joshua the son of Nun,


## Numbers 14:31 (id: 904014031)

31and your children who you said would be for plunder; and I will bring them, and they will know the land, it that you have rejected.


## Numbers 14:32 (id: 904014032)

32And you, your corpses will fall in this wilderness,


## Numbers 14:33 (id: 904014033)

33and your sons will be those who herd in the wilderness 40 years, and they will carry your fornications until the finishing of your corpses in the wilderness.


## Numbers 14:34 (id: 904014034)

34By the number of the days that you explored the land, 40 days, a day for the year, a day for the year, you will carry your iniquities 40 years. And you will know my opposition.


## Numbers 14:35 (id: 904014035)

35I, Yahweh, have spoken. Surely I will do this to all this evil congregation, the ones who have congregated themselves against me. In this wilderness they will finish, and there they will die.’”


## Numbers 14:36 (id: 904014036)

36And the men whom Moses had sent to explore the land and had returned and caused all the congregation to murmur against him by causing an evil report against the land to go out,


## Numbers 14:37 (id: 904014037)

37even the men who had caused to go out the evil report of the evil land, died by the plague before the face of Yahweh.


## Numbers 14:38 (id: 904014038)

38But Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh lived from those men, the ones who went to explore the land.

41And Moses said, “Why this—are you passing over the mouth of Yahweh? And it will not succeed.


## Numbers 14:42 (id: 904014042)

42You shall not go up, because Yahweh is not in the midst of you, that you not be struck down before the face of your enemies.


## Numbers 14:43 (id: 904014043)

43For the Amalekite and the Canaanite are there before your face, and you will fall by the sword, for you have turned from after Yahweh, and therefore Yahweh will not be with you.”

## Numbers 15:3 (id: 904015003)

3then you shall make an offering made by fire to Yahweh, a burnt offering or a sacrifice, to do an extraordinary vow or with a voluntary offering, or at your appointed times, to make an aroma of soothing for Yahweh from the herd or from the flock.

5And wine for the drink offering, a fourth of the hin, you shall make with the burnt offering or for the sacrifice, for the one male lamb.

6Or for the ram you shall make a grain offering, two tenths fine flour mixed with a third of the hin of oil.

7And wine for the drink offering, a third of the hin, you shall offer as an aroma of soothing for Yahweh.

8And when you make a son of cattle a burnt offering or a sacrifice, to do an extraordinary vow or peace offerings to Yahweh,

9then you shall offer with the son of the cattle a grain offering, three tenths fine flour mixed with a half of the hin of the oil,


## Numbers 15:10 (id: 904015010)

10and you shall offer a half of the hin of wine for the drink offering, an offering made by fire, an aroma of soothing for Yahweh.


## Numbers 15:11 (id: 904015011)

11Thus it shall be done for the one ox or for the one ram or for the small livestock among the male lambs or among the goats.


## Numbers 15:12 (id: 904015012)

12According to the number that you do, thus you shall do for the one according to their number.

13Every native shall do these things thus for offering an offering made by fire, an aroma of soothing for Yahweh.


## Numbers 15:14 (id: 904015014)

14And if a sojourner sojourns with you, or whoever is in the midst of you for your generations, and he makes an offering made by fire, an aroma of soothing for Yahweh, just as you shall do, so he shall do.


## Numbers 15:15 (id: 904015015)

15The assembly statute is one for you and for the sojourner, the one who is sojourning, a statute of eternity for your generations. As you, so the sojourner shall be before the face of Yahweh.

## Numbers 15:19 (id: 904015019)

19and it shall be that when you eat from the bread of the land, you shall raise a raised offering to Yahweh.


## Numbers 15:20 (id: 904015020)

20The first of your dough shall be a cake you shall raise as a raised offering. Like a raised offering of the threshing floor, so you shall raise it.


## Numbers 15:21 (id: 904015021)

21From the first of your dough you shall give a raised offering to Yahweh for your generations.


## Numbers 15:22 (id: 904015022)

22And when you stray and do not do all these commandments that Yahweh has spoken to Moses,


## Numbers 15:23 (id: 904015023)

23all that Yahweh has commanded to you by the hand of Moses, from the day that Yahweh commanded and beyond for your generations,


## Numbers 15:24 (id: 904015024)

24and it shall be that, if it was done as unintentional sin away from the eyes of the congregation, then all the congregation shall make a bull, one son of cattle, for a burnt offering, for an aroma of soothing for Yahweh, and its grain offering and its drink offering, according to the ordinance, and one buck of the goats for a sin offering.


## Numbers 15:25 (id: 904015025)

25And the priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the sons of Israel, and it shall be forgiven for them, for it was an unintentional sin, and they have brought their offering, an offering made by fire, to Yahweh, and their sin offering before the face of Yahweh for their unintentional sin.


## Numbers 15:26 (id: 904015026)

26And it shall be forgiven for all the congregation of the sons of Israel and for the sojourner, the one who is sojourning in the midst of them, because of all the people with unintentional sin.

29The native among the sons of Israel and for the sojourner, the one who is sojourning in the midst of them, one instruction shall be for you for the one who does an unintentional sin.


## Numbers 15:30 (id: 904015030)

30But the person who does with a raised hand, from the native and from the sojourner, he is blaspheming Yahweh, and that person shall be cut off from the midst of his people,


## Numbers 15:31 (id: 904015031)

31because he has despised the word of Yahweh and has broken his commandment, that person shall certainly be cut off. His iniquity shall be on him.’”

32And the sons of Israel were in the wilderness, and they found a man gathering pieces of wood on the day of the Sabbath,

33and the ones who found him gathering pieces of wood brought him near to Moses and to Aaron and to all the congregation,


## Numbers 15:34 (id: 904015034)

34and they made him rest in the keeping place, because it had not been declared what should be done to him.


## Numbers 15:35 (id: 904015035)

35And Yahweh said to Moses, “The man shall certainly die, all the congregation stoning him with the stones from the outside of the camp.”


## Numbers 15:36 (id: 904015036)

## Numbers 15:39 (id: 904015039)

39and it shall be for you for a tassel, and you shall see it, and you shall remember all the commandments of Yahweh, and you shall do them. And you shall not explore after your heart and after your eyes, them which you are prostituting after,


## Numbers 15:40 (id: 904015040)

40so that you shall remember and do all my commandments. And you shall be holy ones for your God.


## Numbers 15:41 (id: 904015041)

## Numbers 16:2 (id: 904016002)

2and they rose up before the face of Moses with men from the sons of Israel, 250 leaders of the congregation, the called ones of the appointed meeting, men of name,


## Numbers 16:3 (id: 904016003)

3and they assembled against Moses and against Aaron. And they said to them, “It is much for you! For all of the congregation, all of them, are holy and Yahweh is in their midst. And why do you lift up yourselves above the assembly of Yahweh?”


## Numbers 16:4 (id: 904016004)

4And Moses heard and fell on his face.


## Numbers 16:5 (id: 904016005)

5And he spoke to Korah and to all his congregation, saying, “And in the morning Yahweh will make known who belongs to him and is the holy one and whom he will bring near to him. And him whom he chooses he will bring near to him.


## Numbers 16:6 (id: 904016006)

6Do this: Korah and all his congregation, take for yourselves censers,


## Numbers 16:7 (id: 904016007)

7and put fire in them, and set incense on them before the face of Yahweh tomorrow. And it will happen that the man whom Yahweh chooses, he will be the holy one. It is much for you, sons of Levi!”


## Numbers 16:8 (id: 904016008)

8And Moses said to Korah, “Now listen, sons of Levi:


## Numbers 16:9 (id: 904016009)

9Is it a small thing for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel to bring you near to him to serve the service of the Dwelling of Yahweh and to stand before the face of the congregation to minister to them?


## Numbers 16:10 (id: 904016010)

10And he has brought you near, and all your brothers, the sons of Levi, with you. And you are seeking the priesthood also!


## Numbers 16:11 (id: 904016011)

11Therefore, you and all your congregation are the ones congregating against Yahweh, and Aaron, what is he that you grumble against him?”


## Numbers 16:12 (id: 904016012)

12And Moses sent to call for Dathan and for Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and they said, “We will not go up.


## Numbers 16:13 (id: 904016013)

13Is it a small thing that you have brought us up from a land flowing with milk and honey to make us die in the wilderness? But you have made yourself ruler over us, even to make yourself ruler!


## Numbers 16:14 (id: 904016014)

14Moreover, you have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, or given to us an inheritance of field or vineyard. Will you gouge out the eyes of these men? We will not go up.”


## Numbers 16:15 (id: 904016015)

15And it burned exceedingly for Moses, and he said to Yahweh, “Do not turn to their offering. I have not taken one donkey from them. And I have not harmed one of them.”

16And Moses said to Korah, “You and all your congregation be before the face of Yahweh, you and they and Aaron, tomorrow,

17and take a man his censer, and put incense on them, and bring before the face of Yahweh, a man his censer, 250 censers, and you and Aaron, a man his censer.”


## Numbers 16:18 (id: 904016018)

18And they took a man his censer, and they put fire on it and set incense on it, and they stood at the opening of the tent of meeting with Moses and Aaron.


## Numbers 16:19 (id: 904016019)

19And Korah assembled all the congregation against them at the opening of the tent of meeting, and the glory of Yahweh appeared to all the congregation.


## Numbers 16:20 (id: 904016020)

20And Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,


## Numbers 16:21 (id: 904016021)

21“Separate yourselves from the midst of this congregation, and I shall finish them in a moment.”


## Numbers 16:22 (id: 904016022)

## Numbers 16:23 (id: 904016023)

23And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,


## Numbers 16:24 (id: 904016024)

24“Speak to the congregation, saying, ‘Get yourselves up from around the dwellings of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.’”


## Numbers 16:25 (id: 904016025)

25And Moses rose and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel went after him.


## Numbers 16:26 (id: 904016026)

26And he spoke to the congregation, saying, “Now turn from beside the tents of these wicked men and do not touch anything that belongs to them, lest you be swept away by all their sins.”


## Numbers 16:27 (id: 904016027)

27And they got themselves up from beside the dwelling of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, from all around, and Dathan and Abiram went out, standing at the opening of their tents with their wives and their sons and their little children.


## Numbers 16:28 (id: 904016028)

28And Moses said, “By this you will know that Yahweh has sent me to do all these deeds, that they are not from my heart:


## Numbers 16:29 (id: 904016029)

29If these ones die like the death of every man and the appointment of every man is appointed to them, Yahweh has not sent me.


## Numbers 16:30 (id: 904016030)

30But if Yahweh creates a creation and the ground opens its mouth and swallows them and all that belongs to them and they go down alive to Sheol, then you will know that these men have spurned Yahweh.”


## Numbers 16:31 (id: 904016031)

31And it happened when he finished speaking all these words that the ground that was under them split open.


## Numbers 16:32 (id: 904016032)

32And the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them and their houses and every man who belonged to Korah and all the property.


## Numbers 16:33 (id: 904016033)

33And they went down to Sheol alive, they and all that belonged to them, and the earth covered over them and they perished from the midst of the assembly.


## Numbers 16:34 (id: 904016034)

34And all Israel who was surrounding them fled from their sound, for they said, “Lest the earth swallow us!”


## Numbers 16:35 (id: 904016035)

35And fire went out from with Yahweh, and it ate the 250 men offering the incense.


## Numbers 16:36 (id: 904016036)

36And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,


## Numbers 16:37 (id: 904016037)

37“Say to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, and he shall lift up the censers from between the burning and scatter the fire abroad, for they are holy.


## Numbers 16:38 (id: 904016038)

38And the censers of these sinners against their lives, make them hammered sheets of thin metal, plating for the altar. For they offered them before the face of Yahweh, and they are holy, and they shall be for a sign for the sons of Israel.”


## Numbers 16:39 (id: 904016039)

39And Eleazar the priest took the censers of bronze that the burned ones had offered, and they hammered them as a plating for the altar,


## Numbers 16:40 (id: 904016040)

40a reminder for the sons of Israel, so that an unfamiliar man, he who is not from the seed of Aaron, shall not come near to burn incense before the face of Yahweh, and he shall not be like Korah and his congregation, just as Yahweh spoke by the hand of Moses to him.


## Numbers 16:41 (id: 904016041)

41And all the congregation of the sons of Israel grumbled against Moses and against Aaron from the next day, saying, “You yourselves killed the people of Yahweh!”


## Numbers 16:42 (id: 904016042)

42And it happened when the congregation assembled against Moses and against Aaron that they turned to the tent of meeting, and behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of Yahweh was seen.

43And Moses and Aaron came to the face of the tent of meeting,


## Numbers 16:44 (id: 904016044)

44and Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,


## Numbers 16:45 (id: 904016045)

45“Get yourselves up from the midst of this congregation, and I shall finish them in a moment,” and they fell on their faces.


## Numbers 16:46 (id: 904016046)

46And Moses said to Aaron, “Take the censer, and put fire on it from on the altar, and set incense, and go quickly into the congregation, and make atonement for them, because the wrath has gone out from before the face of Yahweh. The plague has begun.”


## Numbers 16:47 (id: 904016047)

47And Aaron took just as Moses said and ran into the midst of the assembly. And behold, the plague had begun among the people. And he put the incense and made atonement for the people.


## Numbers 16:48 (id: 904016048)

48And he stood between the ones who died and the ones who lived. And the plague was stopped.

2“Speak to the sons of Israel, and take a staff from with them, a staff for the house of a father, from with all their leaders for the house of their fathers, 12 staffs. You shall write a man his name on his staff,


## Numbers 17:3 (id: 904017003)

3and you shall write the name of Aaron on the staff of Levi; for one staff is for the head of the house of their fathers,


## Numbers 17:4 (id: 904017004)

4and you shall rest them in the tent of meeting, before the face of the testimony, there where I meet with you.


## Numbers 17:5 (id: 904017005)

5And it will happen that the man, him whom I choose, his staff will bud. And I will make the grumblings of the sons of Israel that they are grumbling against you cease from against me.”


## Numbers 17:6 (id: 904017006)

## Numbers 17:11 (id: 904017011)

11And Moses did just as Yahweh had commanded him, thus he did.


## Numbers 17:12 (id: 904017012)

12And the sons of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, “Look, we will expire! We will perish! All of us will perish!

## Numbers 21:13 (id: 904021013)

15and the slope of the wadis that spreads out to the dwelling of Ar and it leans to the border of Moab,”

17Then Israel sang this song: “Rise up, well! Sing for it,


## Numbers 21:18 (id: 904021018)

18the well leaders dug, the noblemen of the people dug it, with a decreer’s staff and their staffs.” And from the wilderness to Mattanah

19and from Mattanah to Nahaliel and from Nahaliel to Bamoth

28For fire went out from Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon. It ate Ar of Moab, the lords of the high places of Arnon.


## Numbers 21:29 (id: 904021029)

29Woe to you, Moab! You have perished, people of Chemosh. He has given his sons to be escapees and his daughters into the captivity of Sihon the king of the Amorites.


## Numbers 21:30 (id: 904021030)

## Numbers 22:6 (id: 904022006)

6And now please go curse this people for me because they are more numerous than I. Perhaps I will be able to strike them and drive them out from the land. For I know whom you bless will be blessed, and whom you curse will be cursed.”

14And the leaders of Moab rose and came to Balak, and they said, “Balaam refused to come with us.”

30And the female donkey said to Balaam, “Am I not your female donkey on which you have ridden from your continuance until this day? Have I ever been accustomed to doing thus to you?” And he said, “No.”


## Numbers 22:31 (id: 904022031)

## Numbers 22:33 (id: 904022033)

33And the female donkey saw me and turned aside before my face these three times. If she had not turned aside from me, surely now even you I would have slain and kept her alive.”
