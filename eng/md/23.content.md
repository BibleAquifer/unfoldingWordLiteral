## Isaiah 22:14 (id: 923022014)

14And it was revealed in my ears {by} Yahweh of hosts: “Surely this iniquity will not be forgiven you, even when you die,” says the Lord Yahweh of hosts.

15Thus says the Lord Yahweh of hosts, “You, go to this administrator to Shebna, who {is} over the house,


## Isaiah 22:16 (id: 923022016)

16‘Why {are} you here and who let you here that you are digging for yourself here a tomb, digging his grave {on the} heights, carving out a resting place for himself in the rock?’”


## Isaiah 22:17 (id: 923022017)

17Behold, Yahweh is about to throw you {mighty} man, about to throw you down; and he will grasp you tightly.


## Isaiah 22:18 (id: 923022018)

18He will surely wind you round and round, toss like a ball into a country broad {on} both sides. There you will die, and there the chariots of your glory {will be} the shame of the house of your master.


## Isaiah 22:19 (id: 923022019)

19And I shall thrust you from your office and from your station you will be pulled down.


## Isaiah 22:20 (id: 923022020)

20And it will happen on that day that I shall call my servant Eliakim son of Hilkiah.


## Isaiah 22:21 (id: 923022021)

21And I shall clothe him {with} your tunic and fasten him {with} your sash and give your authority into his hand. And he will be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah.


## Isaiah 22:22 (id: 923022022)

22And I shall place the key {to} the house of David on his shoulder, and he will open, and none will shut, and he will shut, and none will open,


## Isaiah 22:23 (id: 923022023)

23and I shall fasten him, a peg in a secure place, and he will become a seat of glory for the house of his father.


## Isaiah 22:24 (id: 923022024)

24And they will hang on him all the glory of the house of his father, the offspring and descendants, every small vessel from the vessels of the cups and to all the vessels of the jugs.


## Isaiah 22:25 (id: 923022025)

25On that day—the declaration of Yahweh of hosts—the peg driven in a firm place will give way and break off and fall, and the weight that {was} on it will be cut off—for Yahweh has spoken.


## Isaiah 23:1 (id: 923023001)

6Cross over to Tarshish; wail, you inhabitants of the coast.

## Isaiah 23:8 (id: 923023008)

8Who has planned this against Tyre, the giver of crowns, whose merchants {are} princes, whose traders {are} the honored ones of the earth?


## Isaiah 23:9 (id: 923023009)

9Yahweh of hosts has planned it to dishonor the pride of all the glory, to shame all the honored ones of the earth.


## Isaiah 23:10 (id: 923023010)

10Cross over your land like the Nile, you daughter of Tarshish. {There is} no restraint anymore.


## Isaiah 23:11 (id: 923023011)

11He has reached out his hand over the sea; he has shaken the kingdoms. Yahweh has commanded to Canaan to destroy its strongholds.

12And he said, “You will not continue to rejoice again, you oppressed virgin daughter of Sidon; arise, pass over {to} Cyprus; there also you will not have rest.”


## Isaiah 23:13 (id: 923023013)

13Behold, the land of the Chaldeans. This people is naught. The Assyrians have established it for wild animals. They erected their siege towers; they demolished its palaces; they made it ruins.


## Isaiah 23:14 (id: 923023014)

14Howl, you ships of Tarshish; for your refuge has been destroyed.


## Isaiah 23:15 (id: 923023015)

15And it will happen on that day that Tyre will be forgotten 70 years, like the days of one king. After the end of 70 years it will happen in Tyre like {in} the song of the prostitute:


## Isaiah 23:16 (id: 923023016)

16Take a harp, go about the city, you forgotten prostitute; play well, multiply song, so that you may be remembered.

## Isaiah 23:18 (id: 923023018)

## Isaiah 24:2 (id: 923024002)

2And it will happen, as with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the creditor, so with the lender of it.

7The new wine dries up, the vine withers, all the merry\-hearted groan.

11{There is} a crying in the streets because of the wine; all joy is darkened; the gladness of the land has disappeared.

12In the city is left a desolation, and the gate is broken into a ruin.


## Isaiah 24:13 (id: 923024013)

13For thus {it} will be in the midst of the earth among the nations, as when an olive tree is beaten, as the gleanings when the grape harvest is done.


## Isaiah 24:14 (id: 923024014)

14They will lift up their voices, sing for joy, in the majesty of Yahweh joyfully shout from the sea.


## Isaiah 24:15 (id: 923024015)

15Therefore, in the east glorify Yahweh, in the isles of the sea, the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel.


## Isaiah 24:16 (id: 923024016)

## Isaiah 24:23 (id: 923024023)

23Then the white one will be ashamed, and the hot one disgraced, for Yahweh of hosts will reign on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, and before his elders {is his} glory.


## Isaiah 25:1 (id: 923025001)

1Yahweh, you {are} my God, I shall exalt you; I shall praise your name; for you have done wonders planned long ago {in} perfect faithfulness.


## Isaiah 25:2 (id: 923025002)

2For you have made a town into a heap, a fortified city into a ruin, a fortress of strangers from a town, it will not be built forever.


## Isaiah 25:3 (id: 923025003)

3Therefore a strong people will glorify you; a city of ruthless nations will fear you.


## Isaiah 25:4 (id: 923025004)

4For you have been a fortress for the poor, a fortress for the needy in his distress, a shelter from the storm, a shade from the heat. For the breath of the ruthless {is} like a storm {against} a wall,


## Isaiah 25:5 (id: 923025005)

5like heat in a dry land. You subdued the noise of foreigners, {as} the heat by the shade of a cloud. the song of the ruthless is answered.


## Isaiah 25:6 (id: 923025006)

6And Yahweh of hosts will make for all peoples on this mountain a feast of fat things, a feast of choice wines, fat things {full} of marrow, strained wine.


## Isaiah 25:7 (id: 923025007)

7And he will consume on this mountain the face of the veil covering over all peoples and the web woven over all the nations;


## Isaiah 25:8 (id: 923025008)

8he will swallow up death forever. And the Lord Yahweh will wipe away tears from off all faces. And the disgrace of his people he will take away from all the earth, for Yahweh has spoken.

## Isaiah 25:11 (id: 923025011)

12And your high fortress walls he will bring down, bring low, cast to the ground, to the dust.

2Open the gates, that the righteous nation, keeper of faith, may enter in.

6It will be trampled down {by} foot, the feet of the poor, the steps of the needy.

7The way for the righteous {is} level, Righteous One; the path of the righteous you flatten.


## Isaiah 26:8 (id: 923026008)

8Yes, {in} the path of your judgments, Yahweh, we wait {for} you; your name and your reputation {are} the delight of the spirit.


## Isaiah 26:9 (id: 923026009)

9With my soul, I have longed for you in the night; Indeed, my spirit within me seeks you earnestly. For when your judgments {are} on the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.


## Isaiah 26:10 (id: 923026010)

10Let the wicked be favored; he will not learn righteousness: In the land of uprightness he acts wickedly and does not see the majesty of Yahweh.


## Isaiah 26:11 (id: 923026011)

11Yahweh, {when} your hand is lifted up, they do not perceive. Let them see and be ashamed by the zeal for the people, by the fire consuming your adversaries.


## Isaiah 26:12 (id: 923026012)

12Yahweh, you will establish peace for us, for you have indeed accomplished all our works for us.


## Isaiah 26:13 (id: 923026013)

13Yahweh our God, lords besides you have ruled us; only by you we recognize your name.


## Isaiah 26:14 (id: 923026014)

14{They are} dead, they will not live; {they are} deceased, they will not arise. Indeed, you visited and destroyed them, and eradicated every memory of them.


## Isaiah 26:15 (id: 923026015)

15You have increased the nation, Yahweh, you have increased the nation; you are honored; you have extended all the borders of the land.


## Isaiah 26:16 (id: 923026016)

16Yahweh, in distress they visited you {with} uttered prayers, your discipline {was} on them.


## Isaiah 26:17 (id: 923026017)

17As a pregnant {woman} nearing birth writhes {and} cries out in labor pains, so we have been before your face, Yahweh.


## Isaiah 26:18 (id: 923026018)

18We have been pregnant, we have been in labor, as if we have birthed wind. We have not brought salvation to the earth, and the inhabitants of the world have not fallen.


## Isaiah 26:19 (id: 923026019)

19Your dead will live; their corpses will arise. Awake and sing for joy, dwellers of the dust, for your dew {is} the dew of light, and the earth will release the dead.


## Isaiah 26:20 (id: 923026020)

20Go, my people, enter into your rooms, and shut your doors behind you; hide a little while, until the fury has passed by.

21For behold, Yahweh is about to come out of his place to charge the iniquity of the inhabitants of the earth against it, and the earth will uncover her bloodshed, and will no longer cover over her slain.


## Isaiah 27:1 (id: 923027001)

1On that day Yahweh, with his hard and great and fierce sword, will punish Leviathan the slithering serpent, Leviathan the squirming serpent, and he will kill the monster that {is} in the sea.


## Isaiah 27:2 (id: 923027002)

2On that day, a delightful vineyard, sing of it!


## Isaiah 27:3 (id: 923027003)

3“I, Yahweh, guard it. I water it every moment. lest {anyone} hurts it, night and day I guard it.


## Isaiah 27:4 (id: 923027004)

4I do not have anger. Oh, if they would give me briers {and} thorns, in battle I would march against them; I would burn them all together.


## Isaiah 27:5 (id: 923027005)

5If he takes hold of my protection, he makes peace with me; he makes peace with me.


## Isaiah 27:6 (id: 923027006)

6In the coming {day}, Jacob will take root, Israel will blossom and bud, and they will fill the face of the earth with fruit.”


## Isaiah 27:7 (id: 923027007)

7As the attacking of his attacker, has he attacked? Or, like the slaying of his slain, was he slayed?


## Isaiah 27:8 (id: 923027008)

8In a measure, in sending her out, you have contended with her. He released his fierce breath on an east\-wind day.


## Isaiah 27:9 (id: 923027009)

9So in this the iniquity of Jacob will be covered, for this {will be} all the fruit of the removal of his sin: when he will make all the altar stones as chalk stones, crushed to pieces. No Asherah poles or incense altars will stand.


## Isaiah 27:10 (id: 923027010)

10For the fortified city is desolate, the habitation is deserted and forsaken, like the wilderness. There a calf feeds, and there he lies down and consumes its branches.


## Isaiah 27:11 (id: 923027011)

11When its boughs are dry, they will be broken. Women will come, make fires with them, for it is not a people of understanding. Therefore, its Maker will not have compassion on them, and its creator will not be merciful to them.


## Isaiah 27:12 (id: 923027012)

12And it will happen on that day: Yahweh will thresh from the Euphrates River to the Wadi of Egypt, and you will be gathered, one {by} one, sons of Israel.


## Isaiah 27:13 (id: 923027013)

13And it will happen on that day: a great trumpet will be blown, and the perishing in the land of Assyria will come, and the outcasts in the land of Egypt, and they will bow down to Yahweh on the holy mountain in Jerusalem.


## Isaiah 28:1 (id: 923028001)

1Woe, proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim, and the fading flower of its glorious splendor, which {is} on the head of the lush valley of those overcome {with} wine!


## Isaiah 28:2 (id: 923028002)

2Behold, one mighty and strong for my Lord. Like a storm of hail, a destructive windstorm, like a storm of mighty overflowing waters; he brings down to the ground with his hand.


## Isaiah 28:3 (id: 923028003)

3The proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim will be trodden by feet.


## Isaiah 28:4 (id: 923028004)

4And the fading flower of his glorious splendor which {is} on the head of the lush valley, will be as the firstfruits before the summer, that when an onlooker sees it, while it is yet in his palm, he swallows it.


## Isaiah 28:5 (id: 923028005)

5On that day Yahweh of hosts will become a crown of splendor and a diadem of beauty for the remainder of his people,


## Isaiah 28:6 (id: 923028006)

6and a spirit of justice for him who sits in judgment, and for strength of those who turn back war at the gates.


## Isaiah 28:7 (id: 923028007)

7But even these reel with wine and stagger with strong drink. The priest and the prophet reel with strong drink, and they are swallowed up by wine. They stagger with strong drink, staggering in vision, reeling in decision.


## Isaiah 28:8 (id: 923028008)

8For, all tables are covered with vomit of excrement, without a {clean} place.


## Isaiah 28:9 (id: 923028009)

9To whom will he teach knowledge, and to whom will he explain the message? Those weaned from milk, those taken from the breasts?


## Isaiah 28:10 (id: 923028010)

10For {it is} precept upon precept, precept upon precept, line upon line, line upon line, here a little, there a little.


## Isaiah 28:11 (id: 923028011)

11Indeed, with mocking lips and a strange tongue he will speak to this people,


## Isaiah 28:12 (id: 923028012)

12to which he said, “This {is} the rest—leave it for the weary.” And “this {is} the refreshing”— but they were not willing to listen.


## Isaiah 28:13 (id: 923028013)

13So the word of Yahweh will be to them precept upon precept, precept upon precept, line upon line, line upon line, here a little, there a little. so that they may go and fall backward, and be broken and ensnared and captured.


## Isaiah 28:14 (id: 923028014)

14Therefore, hear the word of Yahweh, men of mocking, rulers of this people, who {are} in Jerusalem.


## Isaiah 28:15 (id: 923028015)

15For you have said, “We have cut a covenant {with} death, and with Sheol we have made an agreement. The cascading whip, when it passes through, it will not come to us. For we have made falsehood our refuge, and in lies we shelter.”


## Isaiah 28:16 (id: 923028016)

16Therefore, thus says the Lord Yahweh: See, I shall lay in Zion a stone, a tried stone, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation. He who believes will not be ashamed.


## Isaiah 28:17 (id: 923028017)

17And I shall make justice the measuring stick, and righteousness the plumbline. And hail will sweep away the refuge of falsehood, and the waters will drown the hiding place.


## Isaiah 28:18 (id: 923028018)

18And your covenant {with} death will be dissolved, and your agreement {with} Sheol will not stand. The cascading whip that passes through, you will be overwhelmed by it.


## Isaiah 28:19 (id: 923028019)

19When it passes through, it will take you, for it will pass through morning by morning, by day and night, and to understand the message will be only terror.


## Isaiah 28:20 (id: 923028020)

20For the bed {is} too short to stretch out {on}, and the blanket {too} narrow to wrap oneself.


## Isaiah 28:21 (id: 923028021)

21Yahweh will rise up as {on} Mount Perazim; he will rouse himself as in the Valley of Gibeon to do his work, his strange work, and to perform his deed, his strange deed.


## Isaiah 28:22 (id: 923028022)

22And now, do not mock, lest your bonds be tightened. For I have heard: destruction is decreed from the Lord Yahweh of hosts over all the earth.


## Isaiah 28:23 (id: 923028023)

23Give ear and hear my voice; listen closely and hear my words.


## Isaiah 28:24 (id: 923028024)

24Does a farmer plows all day to sow? Does he break up and harrow the ground?


## Isaiah 28:25 (id: 923028025)

25Does he not level its face, and scatter fennel, and sow the cumin, and put the wheat {in} rows, and the barley in plots, and the spelt at its border?


## Isaiah 28:26 (id: 923028026)

26And His God instructs him; he teaches him wisely.


## Isaiah 28:27 (id: 923028027)

27For fennel is not threshed with a threshing board, nor is the wheel of a cart rolled over cumin; but fennel is beaten with a stick, and cumin with a rod.


## Isaiah 28:28 (id: 923028028)

28For bread it must be ground, so the thresher does not thresh it forever, and he runs {it} over {with} the wheels of his cart but his horses do not crush it.


## Isaiah 28:29 (id: 923028029)

29This too comes from Yahweh of hosts, wonderful {in} counsel, his wisdom great.


## Isaiah 29:1 (id: 923029001)

1Woe, Ariel, Ariel, the city {where} David encamped! Add year to year; let the festivals come round.


## Isaiah 29:2 (id: 923029002)

2And I shall cause distress to Ariel, and she will be mourning and lamenting; and she will be to me like Ariel.


## Isaiah 29:3 (id: 923029003)

3And I shall encamp against you in a circle and lay siege against you {with} siege\-works, and raise against you fortresses.


## Isaiah 29:4 (id: 923029004)

4And you will be brought down and will speak from the ground; your speech will be low from the dust, and your voice will be like {that of} a spirit from the ground, and out of the dust your speech will whisper.


## Isaiah 29:5 (id: 923029005)

5And the horde of your strangers will be like fine dust, and the horde of the oppressors as chaff passing through. And it will happen suddenly, in an instant.


## Isaiah 29:6 (id: 923029006)

6She will be visited by Yahweh of hosts with thunder and with earthquake and a great noise, a storm and a tempest and the flames of a devouring fire.
