## 2 Timothy 1:1 (id: 955001001)

1Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, according to the promise of life that {is} in Christ Jesus,


## 2 Timothy 1:2 (id: 955001002)

2to Timothy, beloved child. Grace, mercy, peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.


## 2 Timothy 1:3 (id: 955001003)

3I have gratitude to God, whom I serve from my ancestors, with a pure conscience, as I have the constant remembrance concerning you in my prayers night and day,


## 2 Timothy 1:4 (id: 955001004)

4longing to see you, remembering your tears, so that I may be filled with joy,


## 2 Timothy 1:5 (id: 955001005)

5having received remembrance of the sincere faith in you, which dwelled first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am persuaded that {it is} also in you.


## 2 Timothy 1:6 (id: 955001006)

6For which reason, I am reminding you to rekindle the gift of God that is in you through the laying on of my hands.


## 2 Timothy 1:7 (id: 955001007)

7For God did not give us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of self\-control.


## 2 Timothy 1:8 (id: 955001008)

8Therefore, do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me, his prisoner, but suffer together for the gospel, according to the power of God,


## 2 Timothy 1:9 (id: 955001009)

9the one having saved us and having called {us} to a holy calling—not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, the {grace} having been given to us in Christ Jesus before eternal times,


## 2 Timothy 1:10 (id: 955001010)

10and now having been revealed through the appearance of our Savior Christ Jesus, both having abolished death and having brought to light life and immortality through the gospel,


## 2 Timothy 1:11 (id: 955001011)

11for which I was appointed a herald and an apostle and a teacher,


## 2 Timothy 1:12 (id: 955001012)

12for which reason I also suffer these things. But I am not ashamed, for I know in whom I have believed, and I have been persuaded that he is able to guard my deposit until that day.


## 2 Timothy 1:13 (id: 955001013)

13Hold the pattern of healthy words that you heard from me, in faith and love {that are} in Christ Jesus.


## 2 Timothy 1:14 (id: 955001014)

14Guard the good deposit through the Holy Spirit, the one dwelling in us.


## 2 Timothy 1:15 (id: 955001015)

15You know this, that all the ones in Asia turned away from me, among whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.


## 2 Timothy 1:16 (id: 955001016)

16May the Lord give mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chain,


## 2 Timothy 1:17 (id: 955001017)

17but being in Rome, he diligently searched for me and found {me}.


## 2 Timothy 1:18 (id: 955001018)

18May the Lord give to him to find mercy from the Lord in that day. And as much as he served in Ephesus, you know very well.


## 2 Timothy 2:1 (id: 955002001)

1You, therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace {that is} in Christ Jesus.


## 2 Timothy 2:2 (id: 955002002)

2And what you have heard from me through many witnesses, place these things before faithful men who will be able to teach others also.


## 2 Timothy 2:3 (id: 955002003)

3Suffer together as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.


## 2 Timothy 2:4 (id: 955002004)

4No one serving as a soldier is entangled in the affairs of life, so that he may please the one having enlisted him.


## 2 Timothy 2:5 (id: 955002005)

5But also, if anyone competes, he is not crowned if he has not competed lawfully.


## 2 Timothy 2:6 (id: 955002006)

6It is necessary for the hardworking farmer first to share in the fruits.


## 2 Timothy 2:7 (id: 955002007)

7Think about what I am saying, for the Lord will give you understanding in everything.


## 2 Timothy 2:8 (id: 955002008)

8Remember Jesus Christ, having been raised from the dead, from the seed of David, according to my gospel,


## 2 Timothy 2:9 (id: 955002009)

9in which I am suffering, even to chains, like a criminal. But the word of God has not been bound.


## 2 Timothy 2:10 (id: 955002010)

10Because of this, I endure all things because of the elect so that they also may obtain salvation {that is} in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.


## 2 Timothy 2:11 (id: 955002011)

11The word {is} trustworthy: “For if we died with {him}, we will also live with {him}.


## 2 Timothy 2:12 (id: 955002012)

12If we endure, we will also reign with {him}. If we deny {him}, he also will deny us.


## 2 Timothy 2:13 (id: 955002013)

13If we are unfaithful, he remains faithful, for he is not able to deny himself.”


## 2 Timothy 2:14 (id: 955002014)

14Remind {them} of these things, declaring before God not to battle about words; {it is} useful for nothing, to the destruction of the ones hearing.


## 2 Timothy 2:15 (id: 955002015)

15Strive to present yourself approved to God, a worker not ashamed, cutting the word of truth straight.


## 2 Timothy 2:16 (id: 955002016)

16But avoid profane, empty sayings, for they will advance further in ungodliness,


## 2 Timothy 2:17 (id: 955002017)

17and their word will have a spreading like gangrene, among whom are Hymenaeus and Philetus,


## 2 Timothy 2:18 (id: 955002018)

18who have missed the mark concerning the truth, saying the resurrection has already happened, and {who} overturn the faith of some.


## 2 Timothy 2:19 (id: 955002019)

19Nevertheless, the firm foundation of God stands, having this seal: “The Lord knew the ones being his,” and “Let everyone naming the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness.”


## 2 Timothy 2:20 (id: 955002020)

20Now in a great house, there are not only gold and silver containers, but also wood and clay, and some for honor and some for dishonor.


## 2 Timothy 2:21 (id: 955002021)

21Therefore, if someone has cleansed himself from these, he will be a container for honor, having been sanctified, useful to the master, having been prepared for every good work.


## 2 Timothy 2:22 (id: 955002022)

22But flee youthful lusts, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with the ones calling on the Lord from a pure heart.


## 2 Timothy 2:23 (id: 955002023)

23But reject foolish and ignorant controversies, knowing that they give birth to battles.


## 2 Timothy 2:24 (id: 955002024)

24But it is necessary for a slave of the Lord not to battle, but to be gentle toward all, able to teach, patient,


## 2 Timothy 2:25 (id: 955002025)

25in meekness educating the ones opposing. God may perhaps give them repentance for knowledge of the truth,


## 2 Timothy 2:26 (id: 955002026)

26and they may become sober again from the trap of the devil, having been captured by him for the will of that one.


## 2 Timothy 3:1 (id: 955003001)

1But know this, that in the last days difficult times will be present.


## 2 Timothy 3:2 (id: 955003002)

2For the men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, proud, blasphemous, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy,


## 2 Timothy 3:3 (id: 955003003)

3unloving, irreconcilable, slanderous, unrestrained, savage, not lovers of the good,


## 2 Timothy 3:4 (id: 955003004)

4traitors, reckless, puffed up, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,


## 2 Timothy 3:5 (id: 955003005)

5having a form of godliness, but denying its power. And turn away from these.


## 2 Timothy 3:6 (id: 955003006)

6For from these are the ones entering into households and taking captive little women having been heaped with sins, being led away by various desires,


## 2 Timothy 3:7 (id: 955003007)

7always learning, and never being able to come to knowledge of the truth.


## 2 Timothy 3:8 (id: 955003008)

8And the way Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so also these oppose the truth, men having been corrupted {in} the mind, unapproved concerning the faith.


## 2 Timothy 3:9 (id: 955003009)

9But they will not advance further, for their foolishness will be obvious to all, as also that of those became.


## 2 Timothy 3:10 (id: 955003010)

10But you have followed my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, endurance,


## 2 Timothy 3:11 (id: 955003011)

11persecutions, sufferings, such as happened to me in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra, what kind of persecutions I endured. And the Lord rescued me from {them} all.


## 2 Timothy 3:12 (id: 955003012)

12But also, all the ones wanting to live godly in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.


## 2 Timothy 3:13 (id: 955003013)

13But evil men and impostors will advance to the worse, leading astray and being led astray.


## 2 Timothy 3:14 (id: 955003014)

14But you, remain in what you learned and were convinced of, knowing from whom you learned,


## 2 Timothy 3:15 (id: 955003015)

15and that from infancy you have known the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith {that is} in Christ Jesus.


## 2 Timothy 3:16 (id: 955003016)

16All Scripture {is} God\-breathed and {is} profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness,


## 2 Timothy 3:17 (id: 955003017)

17so that the man of God may be complete, having been equipped for every good work.


## 2 Timothy 4:1 (id: 955004001)

1I declare before God and Christ Jesus, the one being about to judge living and dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom:


## 2 Timothy 4:2 (id: 955004002)

2Preach the word; stand by opportunely, inopportunely; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all patience and teaching.


## 2 Timothy 4:3 (id: 955004003)

3For there will be a time when they will not bear with the healthy teaching. Instead, they will heap up for themselves teachers according to their own desires, itching {in} the ear,


## 2 Timothy 4:4 (id: 955004004)

4and they will turn the ear away from the truth and be turned away to the myths.


## 2 Timothy 4:5 (id: 955004005)

5But you, be sober in all things. Suffer hardship. Do the work of an evangelist. Fulfill your service.


## 2 Timothy 4:6 (id: 955004006)

6For I am already being poured out as an offering, and the time of my departure is near.


## 2 Timothy 4:7 (id: 955004007)

7I have fought the good fight; I have finished the race; I have kept the faith.


## 2 Timothy 4:8 (id: 955004008)

8From now on, the crown of righteousness is reserved for me, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give to me on that day, and not only to me, but also to all the ones having loved his appearing.


## 2 Timothy 4:9 (id: 955004009)

9Strive to come to me quickly,


## 2 Timothy 4:10 (id: 955004010)

10for Demas has forsaken me, having loved the present age, and has gone to Thessalonica, Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.


## 2 Timothy 4:11 (id: 955004011)

11Only Luke is with me. Taking Mark, bring {him} with you, for he is useful to me for service.


## 2 Timothy 4:12 (id: 955004012)

12But I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.


## 2 Timothy 4:13 (id: 955004013)

13The cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus, coming, bring, and the scrolls, especially the parchments.


## 2 Timothy 4:14 (id: 955004014)

14Alexander the coppersmith showed many evils to me. The Lord will repay him according to his works,


## 2 Timothy 4:15 (id: 955004015)

15whom you also guard yourself against, for he opposed our words very much.


## 2 Timothy 4:16 (id: 955004016)

16At my first defense, no one appeared with me, but all forsook me. May it not be reckoned against them.


## 2 Timothy 4:17 (id: 955004017)

17But the Lord stood with me and strengthened me, so that through me the proclamation might be fulfilled and all the Gentiles might hear. And I was rescued out of the mouth of the lion.


## 2 Timothy 4:18 (id: 955004018)

18The Lord will rescue me from every evil work and will save {me} for his heavenly kingdom. To him {be} the glory forever {and} ever. Amen.


## 2 Timothy 4:19 (id: 955004019)

19Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.


## 2 Timothy 4:20 (id: 955004020)

20Erastus remained in Corinth, and Trophimus I left in Miletus, being sick.


## 2 Timothy 4:21 (id: 955004021)

21Strive to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, and Pudens and Linus and Claudia and the brothers.


## 2 Timothy 4:22 (id: 955004022)

22The Lord {be} with your spirit. Grace {be} with you.
