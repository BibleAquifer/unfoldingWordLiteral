## John 1:1 (id: 943001001)

1In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.


## John 1:2 (id: 943001002)

2He was in the beginning with God.


## John 1:3 (id: 943001003)

3All things came into being through him, and without him came into being not one thing that has come into being.


## John 1:4 (id: 943001004)

4In him was life, and the life was the light of men.


## John 1:5 (id: 943001005)

5And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it.


## John 1:6 (id: 943001006)

6There was a man—having been sent from God—his name {was} John.


## John 1:7 (id: 943001007)

7He came as a witness in order that he might testify about the light, so that all might believe through him.


## John 1:8 (id: 943001008)

8That one was not the light, but {came} so that he might testify about the light.


## John 1:9 (id: 943001009)

9The true light, which gives light to all men, was coming into the world.


## John 1:10 (id: 943001010)

10He was in the world, and the world came into being through him, and the world did not know him.


## John 1:11 (id: 943001011)

11He came to his own, and his own did not receive him.


## John 1:12 (id: 943001012)

12But as many as received him, he gave to them the authority to become children of God, to the ones believing in his name,


## John 1:13 (id: 943001013)

13the ones not born from bloods, nor from the will of the flesh, nor from the will of a man, but from God.


## John 1:14 (id: 943001014)

14And the Word became flesh and dwelled among us, and we beheld his glory, glory as of the One and Only from the Father, full of grace and truth.


## John 1:15 (id: 943001015)

15John testifies about him and has cried out, saying, “This was the one of whom I said, ‘The one coming after me has become greater than me, for he was before me.’”


## John 1:16 (id: 943001016)

16For from his fullness we have all received even grace after grace.


## John 1:17 (id: 943001017)

17For the law was given through Moses. Grace and truth came about through Jesus Christ.


## John 1:18 (id: 943001018)

18No one has seen God at any time. The One and Only God, the one being in the bosom of the Father, that one has made {him} known.


## John 1:19 (id: 943001019)

19And this is the testimony of John when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem so that they might ask him, “Who are you?”


## John 1:20 (id: 943001020)

20And he confessed—and he did not deny, but confessed—“I am not the Christ.”


## John 1:21 (id: 943001021)

21And they asked him, “What then? Are you Elijah?” And he says, “I am not.” “Are you the Prophet?” And he answered, “No.”


## John 1:22 (id: 943001022)

22Then they said to him, “Who are you, so that we might give an answer to the ones having sent us? What do you say about yourself?”


## John 1:23 (id: 943001023)

23He said, “I am a voice, crying out in the wilderness: ‘Make the way of the Lord straight,’ just as Isaiah the prophet said.”


## John 1:24 (id: 943001024)

24And the ones that had been sent were from the Pharisees,


## John 1:25 (id: 943001025)

25and they asked him and said to him, “Why do you baptize then if you are not the Christ nor Elijah nor the Prophet?”


## John 1:26 (id: 943001026)

26John answered them, saying, “I baptize in water. In the midst of you stands one you do not know,


## John 1:27 (id: 943001027)

27the one coming after me, of whom I am not worthy that I might untie the strap of his sandal.”


## John 1:28 (id: 943001028)

28These things came about in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.


## John 1:29 (id: 943001029)

29The next day he sees Jesus coming to him and says, “Behold, the Lamb of God, the one taking away the sin of the world!


## John 1:30 (id: 943001030)

30This is he concerning whom I said, ‘After me comes a man who has become greater than me, for he was before me.’


## John 1:31 (id: 943001031)

31And I did not know him, but so that he might be revealed to Israel, because of this, I came baptizing in water.”


## John 1:32 (id: 943001032)

32And John testified, saying, “I saw the Spirit descending like a dove from heaven, and it remained upon him.


## John 1:33 (id: 943001033)

33And I did not recognize him, but the one having sent me to baptize in water, that one said to me, ‘Upon whomever you might see the Spirit descending and remaining on him, he is the one baptizing in the Holy Spirit.’


## John 1:34 (id: 943001034)

34And I have seen and have testified that this is the Son of God.”


## John 1:35 (id: 943001035)

35The next day, John was standing again with two of his disciples,


## John 1:36 (id: 943001036)

36and having seen Jesus walking by, he says, “Behold, the Lamb of God!”


## John 1:37 (id: 943001037)

37And his two disciples heard {him} speaking, and they followed Jesus.


## John 1:38 (id: 943001038)

38But Jesus, having turned and having seen them following, says to them, “What do you seek?” And they said to him, “Rabbi (which being translated means Teacher), where are you staying?”


## John 1:39 (id: 943001039)

39He says to them, “Come and you will see.” So they came and saw where he is staying, and they stayed with him that day. It was about the tenth hour.


## John 1:40 (id: 943001040)

40One of the two having heard from John and having followed him was Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter.


## John 1:41 (id: 943001041)

41This one first finds his own brother Simon and says to him, “We have found the Messiah” (which is translated “Christ”).


## John 1:42 (id: 943001042)

42He brought him to Jesus. Jesus, having looked at him, said, “You are Simon, the son of John. You will be called Cephas” (which is translated “Peter”).


## John 1:43 (id: 943001043)

43The next day Jesus wanted to go away to Galilee, and he finds Philip and says to him, “Follow me.”


## John 1:44 (id: 943001044)

44Now Philip was from Bethsaida, from the city of Andrew and Peter.


## John 1:45 (id: 943001045)

45Philip finds Nathaniel and says to him, “We have found the one whom Moses wrote about in the law, and the prophets—Jesus son of Joseph, from Nazareth.”


## John 1:46 (id: 943001046)

46And Nathaniel said to him, “Is any good thing able to be from Nazareth?” Philip says to him, “Come and see.”


## John 1:47 (id: 943001047)

47Jesus saw Nathaniel coming to him and says about him, “Behold, a true Israelite, in whom is no deceit!”


## John 1:48 (id: 943001048)

48Nathaniel says to him, “How do you know me?” Jesus answered and said to him, “Before Philip called you, being under the fig tree, I saw you.”


## John 1:49 (id: 943001049)

49Nathaniel replied to him, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are King of Israel!”


## John 1:50 (id: 943001050)

50Jesus replied and said to him, “Because I said to you that I saw you underneath the fig tree, do you believe? You will see greater things than these.”


## John 1:51 (id: 943001051)

51And he says to him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, you will see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.”


## John 2:1 (id: 943002001)

1And on the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.


## John 2:2 (id: 943002002)

2Now Jesus also was invited, and his disciples, to the wedding.


## John 2:3 (id: 943002003)

3And having run out of wine, the mother of Jesus says to him, “They do not have wine.”


## John 2:4 (id: 943002004)

4And Jesus says to her, “Woman, what to me and to you? My hour is not yet come.”


## John 2:5 (id: 943002005)

5His mother says to the servants, “Whatever he might say to you, do.”


## John 2:6 (id: 943002006)

6Now there were six stone water pots standing there for the ceremonial washing of the Jews, each containing two or three metretes.


## John 2:7 (id: 943002007)

7Jesus says to them, “Fill the water pots with water.” And they filled them up to the brim.


## John 2:8 (id: 943002008)

8And he says to them, “Draw now and take {it} to the head waiter.” And they carried {it}.


## John 2:9 (id: 943002009)

9But as the head waiter tasted the water that had become wine (and he did not know where it was from, but the servants—the ones that had drawn the water—knew), the head waiter calls the bridegroom


## John 2:10 (id: 943002010)

10and says to him, “Every man serves the good wine first, and the cheaper wine when they have become drunk. You have kept the good wine until now.”


## John 2:11 (id: 943002011)

11This beginning of the signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and he revealed his glory, and his disciples believed in him.


## John 2:12 (id: 943002012)

12After this he and his mother and brothers and his disciples went down to Capernaum, and they stayed there not many days.


## John 2:13 (id: 943002013)

13And the Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.


## John 2:14 (id: 943002014)

14And he found in the temple the ones selling oxen and sheep and pigeons, and the money changers sitting there.


## John 2:15 (id: 943002015)

15And having made a whip from cords, he drove {them} all out from the temple, and the sheep and the oxen, and he scattered the coins of the money changers and overthrew their tables.


## John 2:16 (id: 943002016)

16And to the ones selling pigeons, he said, “Take these things away from here. Do not make the house of my Father a house of commerce.”


## John 2:17 (id: 943002017)

17His disciples remembered that it is written, “Zeal for your house will consume me.”


## John 2:18 (id: 943002018)

18Then the Jews responded and said to him, “What sign do you show us, since you are doing these things?”


## John 2:19 (id: 943002019)

19Jesus answered and said to them, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.”


## John 2:20 (id: 943002020)

20Then the Jews said, “This temple was built in 46 years, and you will raise it up in three days?”


## John 2:21 (id: 943002021)

21But that one was speaking about the temple of his body.


## John 2:22 (id: 943002022)

22Therefore, when he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he said this, and they believed the Scripture and the word that Jesus had spoken.


## John 2:23 (id: 943002023)

23Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover, at the festival, many believed in his name, seeing his signs that he was doing.


## John 2:24 (id: 943002024)

24But Jesus himself did not trust himself to them because he knew all {men}


## John 2:25 (id: 943002025)

25and because he did not have need that anyone would testify about man, for he himself knew what was in man.


## John 3:1 (id: 943003001)

1Now there was a man from the Pharisees, Nicodemus {was} his name, a ruler of the Jews.


## John 3:2 (id: 943003002)

2This one came to him at night and said to him, “Rabbi, we know that you have come from God as a teacher, for no one is able to do these signs that you do unless God is with him.”


## John 3:3 (id: 943003003)

3Jesus replied and said to him, “Truly, truly I say to you, unless someone would be born again, he is not able to see the kingdom of God.”


## John 3:4 (id: 943003004)

4Nicodemus says to him, “How is a man able to be born, being an old man? He is not able to enter a second time into the womb of his mother and to be born, is he?”


## John 3:5 (id: 943003005)

5Jesus answered, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless someone would be born from water and Spirit, he is not able to enter into the kingdom of God.


## John 3:6 (id: 943003006)

6{What} has been born from the flesh is flesh, and {what} has been born from the Spirit is spirit.


## John 3:7 (id: 943003007)

7Do not be amazed that I said to you, ‘It is necessary for you to be born again.’


## John 3:8 (id: 943003008)

8The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So is everyone having been born from the Spirit.”


## John 3:9 (id: 943003009)

9Nicodemus replied and said to him, “How are these things able to happen?”


## John 3:10 (id: 943003010)

10Jesus answered and said to him, “Are you the teacher of Israel and yet you do not understand these things?


## John 3:11 (id: 943003011)

11Truly, truly, I say to you that we speak {what} we know, and we testify about {what} we have seen, and you do not receive our testimony.


## John 3:12 (id: 943003012)

12If I told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?


## John 3:13 (id: 943003013)

13And no one has ascended into heaven except the one having descended from heaven—the Son of Man.


## John 3:14 (id: 943003014)

14And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, thus it is necessary for the Son of Man to be lifted up


## John 3:15 (id: 943003015)

15so that everyone believing in him may have eternal life.


## John 3:16 (id: 943003016)

16For God so loved the world, that he gave his One and Only Son, so that everyone believing in him would not perish but would have eternal life.


## John 3:17 (id: 943003017)

17For God did not send the Son into the world so that he might condemn the world, but so that the world might be saved through him.


## John 3:18 (id: 943003018)

18The one believing in him is not condemned, but the one not believing has already been condemned because he has not believed in the name of the One and Only Son of God.


## John 3:19 (id: 943003019)

19Now this is the judgment: that the light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light, for their deeds were evil.


## John 3:20 (id: 943003020)

20For everyone is doing evil hates the light and does not come to the light, so that his deeds might not be exposed.


## John 3:21 (id: 943003021)

21But the one doing the truth comes to the light, so that his deeds might be revealed, that they have been worked in God.”


## John 3:22 (id: 943003022)

22After these things, Jesus and his disciples went into the land of Judea, and he tarried there with them and was baptizing.


## John 3:23 (id: 943003023)

23Now John was also baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because much water was there, and they were coming and were being baptized—


## John 3:24 (id: 943003024)

24for John had not yet been thrown into prison.


## John 3:25 (id: 943003025)

25Then a dispute came about from the disciples of John with a Jew concerning ceremonial washing.


## John 3:26 (id: 943003026)

26And they went to John and said to him, “Rabbi, the one who was with you beyond the Jordan, about whom you had testified, behold, he is baptizing, and they are all going to him.”


## John 3:27 (id: 943003027)

27John replied and said, “A man is not able to receive anything unless it has been given to him from heaven.


## John 3:28 (id: 943003028)

28You yourselves testify to me that I said, ‘I am not the Christ,’ but, ‘I have been sent before that one.’


## John 3:29 (id: 943003029)

29The one having the bride is the bridegroom. But the friend of the bridegroom, the one having stood and hearing him, rejoices with joy because of the voice of the bridegroom. Therefore, this my joy has been made complete.


## John 3:30 (id: 943003030)

30It is necessary for that one to increase, but for me to decrease.


## John 3:31 (id: 943003031)

31The one coming from above is above all things. The one being from the earth is from the earth and speaks from the earth. The one coming from heaven is above all things.


## John 3:32 (id: 943003032)

32He testifies about that which he has seen and heard, but no one receives his testimony.


## John 3:33 (id: 943003033)

33The one having received his testimony has set his seal that God is true.


## John 3:34 (id: 943003034)

34For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God. For he does not give the Spirit by measure.


## John 3:35 (id: 943003035)

35The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand.


## John 3:36 (id: 943003036)

36The one believing in the Son has eternal life, but the one disobeying the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.”


## John 4:1 (id: 943004001)

1Then when Jesus knew that the Pharisees heard that Jesus is making and baptizing more disciples than John


## John 4:2 (id: 943004002)

2(although Jesus himself was not baptizing, but his disciples),


## John 4:3 (id: 943004003)

3he left Judea and went back again to Galilee.


## John 4:4 (id: 943004004)

4Now it was necessary for him to go through Samaria.


## John 4:5 (id: 943004005)

5Then he comes to a town of Samaria called Sychar, near the piece of land that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.


## John 4:6 (id: 943004006)

6Now the well of Jacob was there. Then Jesus, having grown weary from the journey, was sitting right beside the well. It was about the sixth hour.


## John 4:7 (id: 943004007)

7A woman from Samaria comes to draw water. Jesus says to her, “Give me to drink,”


## John 4:8 (id: 943004008)

8for his disciples had gone away into the city so that they might buy food.


## John 4:9 (id: 943004009)

9Then the Samaritan woman says to him, “How do you, being a Jew, ask from me to drink, being a Samaritan woman?” (For Jews do not have dealings with Samaritans.)


## John 4:10 (id: 943004010)

10Jesus answered and said to her, “If you had known the gift of God and who is the one saying to you, ‘Give me to drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.”


## John 4:11 (id: 943004011)

11The woman says to him, “Sir, you do not have a vessel and the well is deep. From where then do you have the living water?


## John 4:12 (id: 943004012)

12You are not greater, are you, than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, and his sons and his cattle?”


## John 4:13 (id: 943004013)

13Jesus answered and said to her, “Everyone drinking from this water will thirst again,


## John 4:14 (id: 943004014)

14but whoever drinks from the water that I will give him will never thirst into eternity. Instead, the water that I will give him will become a fountain of water in him, springing up to eternal life.”


## John 4:15 (id: 943004015)

15The woman says to him, “Sir, give me this water so that I might not thirst and might not come here to draw {water}.”


## John 4:16 (id: 943004016)

16He says to her, “Go, call your husband, and come here.”


## John 4:17 (id: 943004017)

17The woman answered and said to him, “I do not have a husband.” Jesus says to her, “You have rightly said, ‘I do not have a husband,’


## John 4:18 (id: 943004018)

18for you have had five husbands, and the one whom you now have is not your husband. This you have said is true.”


## John 4:19 (id: 943004019)

19The woman says to him, “Sir, I see that you are a prophet.


## John 4:20 (id: 943004020)

20Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you say that in Jerusalem is the place where it is necessary to worship.”


## John 4:21 (id: 943004021)

21Jesus says to her, “Believe me, woman, that an hour is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.


## John 4:22 (id: 943004022)

22You worship what you do not know. We worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews.


## John 4:23 (id: 943004023)

23However, an hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for indeed the Father seeks such ones worshiping him.


## John 4:24 (id: 943004024)

24God is spirit, and it is necessary for the ones worshiping him to worship in spirit and truth.”


## John 4:25 (id: 943004025)

25The woman says to him, “I know that Messiah is coming (the one called Christ). When he comes, that one will declare everything to us.”


## John 4:26 (id: 943004026)

26Jesus says to her, “I am, the one speaking to you.”


## John 4:27 (id: 943004027)

27And at this, his disciples came, and they were amazed that he was speaking with a woman. Nevertheless, no one said, “What are you seeking?” or “Why are you speaking with her?”


## John 4:28 (id: 943004028)

28Then the woman left her water pot and went back into the town and says to the men,


## John 4:29 (id: 943004029)

29“Come, see a man who told me all things, as much as I have done. This is not the Christ, is it?”


## John 4:30 (id: 943004030)

30They went out from the town and came to him.


## John 4:31 (id: 943004031)

31In the meantime, the disciples were urging him, saying, “Rabbi, eat.”


## John 4:32 (id: 943004032)

32But he said to them, “I have food to eat that you do not know.”


## John 4:33 (id: 943004033)

33So the disciples said to each other, “No one brought him to eat, did he?”


## John 4:34 (id: 943004034)

34Jesus says to them, “My food is that I might do the will of the one having sent me and might complete his work.


## John 4:35 (id: 943004035)

35Do you not say, ‘There are still four months, and the harvest comes’? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes and see the fields, for they are already white for harvest!


## John 4:36 (id: 943004036)

36The one harvesting receives wages and gathers fruit for eternal life, so that the one sowing and the one harvesting might rejoice together.


## John 4:37 (id: 943004037)

37For in this the saying is true, ‘One is the one sowing, and another, the one harvesting.’


## John 4:38 (id: 943004038)

38I sent you to harvest that on which you have not labored. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.”


## John 4:39 (id: 943004039)

39Now many of the Samaritans from that city believed in him because of the report of the woman, testifying, “He told me all things that I have done.”


## John 4:40 (id: 943004040)

40So when the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to stay with them, and he stayed there two days.


## John 4:41 (id: 943004041)

41And many more believed because of his word.


## John 4:42 (id: 943004042)

42And they said to the woman, “We no longer believe because of your speech, for we ourselves have heard, and we know that this one is truly the Savior of the world.”


## John 4:43 (id: 943004043)

43Now after the two days, he departed from there into Galilee;


## John 4:44 (id: 943004044)

44for Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.


## John 4:45 (id: 943004045)

45When therefore he came into Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, having seen all {the things}, as much as he had done in Jerusalem at the festival, for they had also gone to the festival.


## John 4:46 (id: 943004046)

46Then he came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had made the water wine, and there was a certain royal official whose son in Capernaum was ill.


## John 4:47 (id: 943004047)

47He, having heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, went to him and asked that he would come down and heal his son, for he was about to die.


## John 4:48 (id: 943004048)

48Then Jesus said to him, “Unless you would see signs and wonders, you would certainly not believe.”


## John 4:49 (id: 943004049)

49The royal official says to him, “Sir, come down before my child dies.”


## John 4:50 (id: 943004050)

50Jesus says to him, “Go. Your son lives.” The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he went away.


## John 4:51 (id: 943004051)

51Now while he was going down, his servants met him and reported {to him}, saying that his son lives.


## John 4:52 (id: 943004052)

52So he asked from them the hour in which he began to improve. Therefore, they replied to him, “Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.”


## John 4:53 (id: 943004053)

53Then the father realized {that it was at that} hour in which Jesus had said to him, “Your son lives.” And he himself and his whole household believed.


## John 4:54 (id: 943004054)

54Now Jesus again did this second sign, having come from Judea to Galilee.


## John 5:1 (id: 943005001)

1After these things, there was a festival of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.


## John 5:2 (id: 943005002)

2Now in Jerusalem by the Sheep Gate there is a pool, in Hebrew being called Bethesda, having five roofed porches.


## John 5:3 (id: 943005003)

3In these were lying a crowd of the ones being sick, blind, lame, {or} paralyzed.


## John 5:4 (id: 943005004)

4\[For an angel of the Lord went down into the pool and stirred up the water at certain times, {and} then the one having first stepped in after the stirring of the water was healed from whatever disease he suffered from.]


## John 5:5 (id: 943005005)

5Now a certain man was there, having 38 years in his illness.


## John 5:6 (id: 943005006)

6Jesus, having seen this one lying there and having known that he already is there a long time, says to him, “Do you want to be healthy?”


## John 5:7 (id: 943005007)

7The sick one replied to him, “Sir, I do not have a man so that, when the water is stirred up, he might put me into the pool. But as I am going into it, another goes down before me.”


## John 5:8 (id: 943005008)

8Jesus says to him, “Get up, take up your bed, and walk.”


## John 5:9 (id: 943005009)

9And immediately the man became healthy, and he took up his bed and began to walk. Now that day was a Sabbath.


## John 5:10 (id: 943005010)

10So the Jews said to the one healed, “It is the Sabbath and not permitted for you to carry your bed.”


## John 5:11 (id: 943005011)

11But he replied to them, “The one having made me healthy, that one said to me, ‘Pick up your bed and walk.’”


## John 5:12 (id: 943005012)

12They asked him, “Who is the man having said to you, ‘Pick {it} up and walk’?”


## John 5:13 (id: 943005013)

13But the one having been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had gone away secretly, a crowd being in the place.


## John 5:14 (id: 943005014)

14After these things, Jesus finds him in the temple and said to him, “Behold, you have become healthy! No longer sin, so that something worse might not happen to you.”


## John 5:15 (id: 943005015)

15The man went away and announced to the Jews that Jesus is the one having made him healthy.


## John 5:16 (id: 943005016)

16And because of this, the Jews began to persecute Jesus, because he was doing these things on the Sabbath.


## John 5:17 (id: 943005017)

17But he replied to them, “My Father is working even now, and I am working.”


## John 5:18 (id: 943005018)

18Because of this, therefore, the Jews sought even more to kill him, because he not only was breaking the Sabbath, but also was calling God his own Father, making himself equal to God.


## John 5:19 (id: 943005019)

19Therefore, Jesus answered and said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son is able to do nothing from himself except only what he would see the Father doing, for whatever that one would do, these things also the Son does in the same way.


## John 5:20 (id: 943005020)

20For the Father loves the Son and he shows him everything that he himself does, and he will show him greater works than these so that you might be amazed.


## John 5:21 (id: 943005021)

21For just as the Father raises the dead and makes {them} alive, so also the Son makes alive whom he desires.


## John 5:22 (id: 943005022)

22For not even the Father judges anyone, but he has given all judgment to the Son


## John 5:23 (id: 943005023)

23so that all will honor the Son just as they honor the Father. The one not honoring the Son does not honor the Father having sent him.


## John 5:24 (id: 943005024)

24Truly, truly, I say to you that the one hearing my word and believing the one having sent me has eternal life and does not come into judgment, but he has passed from death to life.


## John 5:25 (id: 943005025)

25Truly, truly, I say to you that an hour is coming, and is now, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and the ones having heard will live.


## John 5:26 (id: 943005026)

26For just as the Father has life in himself, so also he gave to the Son to have life in himself,


## John 5:27 (id: 943005027)

27and he gave him authority to do judgment, because he is the Son of Man.


## John 5:28 (id: 943005028)

28Do not be amazed at this, for an hour is coming in which all the ones in the tombs will hear his voice


## John 5:29 (id: 943005029)

29and will come out—the ones having done good, to a resurrection of life, but the ones having practiced evil, to a resurrection of judgment.


## John 5:30 (id: 943005030)

30I am able to do nothing from myself. Just as I hear, I judge, and my judgment is righteous because I do not seek my own will but the will of the one having sent me.


## John 5:31 (id: 943005031)

31If I testify about myself, my testimony is not true.


## John 5:32 (id: 943005032)

32There is another one testifying about me, and I know that the testimony that he testifies about me is true.


## John 5:33 (id: 943005033)

33You have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth.


## John 5:34 (id: 943005034)

34But I do not receive the testimony from man, but I say these things so that you might be saved.


## John 5:35 (id: 943005035)

35That one was the lamp that was burning and shining, but you desired to exult in his light for an hour.


## John 5:36 (id: 943005036)

36But I have the testimony that is greater than that of John: for the works that the Father has given me so that I would accomplish them—the very works that I do—testify about me that the Father has sent me.


## John 5:37 (id: 943005037)

37And the Father having sent me has himself testified about me. You have neither heard his voice nor have seen his form at any time.


## John 5:38 (id: 943005038)

38And you do not have his word remaining in you, for the one whom he has sent, this one you do not believe.


## John 5:39 (id: 943005039)

39You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life, and these are the ones testifying about me,


## John 5:40 (id: 943005040)

40and you are not willing to come to me so that you might have life.


## John 5:41 (id: 943005041)

41I do not receive glory from men,


## John 5:42 (id: 943005042)

42but I know you, that you do not have the love of God in yourselves.


## John 5:43 (id: 943005043)

43I have come in the name of my Father, and you do not receive me. If another comes in his own name, you receive that one.


## John 5:44 (id: 943005044)

44How are you able to believe, receiving glory from one another, and are not seeking the glory that is from the only God?


## John 5:45 (id: 943005045)

45Do not think that I myself will accuse you before the Father. The one accusing you is Moses, in whom you have hoped.


## John 5:46 (id: 943005046)

46For if you believed Moses, you would believe me, because that one wrote about me.


## John 5:47 (id: 943005047)

47But if you do not believe the writings of that one, how will you believe my words?”


## John 6:1 (id: 943006001)

1After these things, Jesus went away to the other side of the Sea of Galilee (of Tiberias).


## John 6:2 (id: 943006002)

2Now a great crowd was following him because they were seeing the signs that he was doing on the ones being sick.


## John 6:3 (id: 943006003)

3Now Jesus went up on the mountain, and there he sat down with his disciples.


## John 6:4 (id: 943006004)

4(Now the Passover, the festival of the Jews, was near.)


## John 6:5 (id: 943006005)

5Then Jesus, having lifted up his eyes and having seen that a great crowd is coming to him, says to Philip, “From where might we buy bread so that these might eat?”


## John 6:6 (id: 943006006)

6(But he said this, testing him, for he himself knew what he was going to do.)


## John 6:7 (id: 943006007)

7Philip answered him, “200 denarii {worth} of bread is not sufficient for them, so that each one might receive a little.”


## John 6:8 (id: 943006008)

8One of his disciples, Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, says to him,


## John 6:9 (id: 943006009)

9“Here is a little boy who has five barley bread loaves and two small fish, but what are these to so many?”


## John 6:10 (id: 943006010)

10Jesus said, “Make the men sit down.” (Now there was a lot of grass in the place.) So the men sat down, about 5,000 in number.


## John 6:11 (id: 943006011)

11Then Jesus took the loaves, and having given thanks, he gave them to the ones reclining to eat; likewise also with the fish, as much as they wanted.


## John 6:12 (id: 943006012)

12But as they were filled, he says to his disciples, “Gather up the remaining broken pieces, so that nothing might be lost.”


## John 6:13 (id: 943006013)

13So they gathered them up and filled 12 baskets of broken pieces from the five barley loaves which were left over by the ones having eaten.


## John 6:14 (id: 943006014)

14Therefore, the men, having seen the sign he did, said, “This truly is the Prophet coming into the world.”


## John 6:15 (id: 943006015)

15Then Jesus, having realized that they were about to come and to seize him so that they might make {him} king, withdrew again onto the mountain by himself alone.


## John 6:16 (id: 943006016)

16Now as it became evening, his disciples went down to the sea,


## John 6:17 (id: 943006017)

17and having gotten into a boat, they were going over the sea to Capernaum, and darkness had already happened, but Jesus had not yet come to them.


## John 6:18 (id: 943006018)

18A strong wind was blowing, and the sea was being aroused.


## John 6:19 (id: 943006019)

19Then, having rowed about 25 or 30 stadia, they see Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat, and they were frightened.


## John 6:20 (id: 943006020)

20But he says to them, “It is I! Do not be afraid.”


## John 6:21 (id: 943006021)

21Then they were willing to receive him into the boat, and immediately the boat came to the land to which they were going.


## John 6:22 (id: 943006022)

22The next day, the crowd that had been standing on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there except one and that Jesus had not entered into the boat with his disciples, but that his disciples had departed alone.


## John 6:23 (id: 943006023)

23Other boats came from Tiberias close to the place where they had eaten the bread loaves after the Lord had given thanks.


## John 6:24 (id: 943006024)

24Therefore, when the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor his disciples are there, they themselves got into the boats and went to Capernaum seeking Jesus.


## John 6:25 (id: 943006025)

25And having found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, “Rabbi, when did you come here?”


## John 6:26 (id: 943006026)

26Jesus replied to them and said, “Truly, truly, I say to you, you seek me not because you saw signs, but because you ate from the bread loaves and were filled.


## John 6:27 (id: 943006027)

27Do not work for the food that perishes, but for the food that endures to eternal life which the Son of Man will give you, for God the Father has set his seal on this one.”


## John 6:28 (id: 943006028)

28Then they said to him, “What should we do, so that we might work the works of God?”


## John 6:29 (id: 943006029)

29Jesus replied and said to them, “This is the work of God: that you would believe in the one whom that one has sent.”


## John 6:30 (id: 943006030)

30So they said to him, “What sign then do you do, so that we might see and might believe you? What will you work?


## John 6:31 (id: 943006031)

31Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, just as it is written, ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’”


## John 6:32 (id: 943006032)

32Then Jesus replied to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, Moses has not given you the bread from heaven, but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.


## John 6:33 (id: 943006033)

33For the bread of God is the one coming down from heaven and giving life to the world.”


## John 6:34 (id: 943006034)

34So they said to him, “Sir, give us this bread always.”


## John 6:35 (id: 943006035)

35Jesus said to them, “I am the bread of life. The one coming to me will certainly not hunger, and the one believing in me will certainly not ever thirst.


## John 6:36 (id: 943006036)

36But I told you that you have both seen me and do not believe.


## John 6:37 (id: 943006037)

37Everyone whom the Father gives me will come to me, and the one coming to me I will certainly not throw out.


## John 6:38 (id: 943006038)

38For I have come down from heaven, not in order that I might do my own will, but the will of the one having sent me.


## John 6:39 (id: 943006039)

39But this is the will of the one having sent me, that I would not lose from it anyone whom he has given me, but will raise it up on the last day.


## John 6:40 (id: 943006040)

40For this is the will of my Father, that everyone seeing the Son and believing in him would have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.”


## John 6:41 (id: 943006041)

41Then the Jews began to murmur about him because he said, “I am the bread having come down from heaven.”


## John 6:42 (id: 943006042)

42And they said, “Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How then does he now say, ‘I have come down from heaven’?”


## John 6:43 (id: 943006043)

43Jesus replied and said to them, “Do not murmur among yourselves.


## John 6:44 (id: 943006044)

44No one is able to come to me unless the Father having sent me would draw him, and I will raise him up on the last day.


## John 6:45 (id: 943006045)

45It is written in the prophets, ‘And all will be taught by God.’ Everyone having heard and having learned from the Father comes to me.


## John 6:46 (id: 943006046)

46Not that anyone has seen the Father, except the one being from God—he has seen the Father.


## John 6:47 (id: 943006047)

47Truly, truly, I say to you, the one believing has eternal life.


## John 6:48 (id: 943006048)

48I am the bread of life.


## John 6:49 (id: 943006049)

49Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.


## John 6:50 (id: 943006050)

50This is the bread which comes down from heaven, so that a {person} might eat from it and might not die.


## John 6:51 (id: 943006051)

51I am the living bread that has come down from heaven. If anyone eats from this bread, he will live into eternity. Now my flesh is also the bread that I will give for the life of the world.”


## John 6:52 (id: 943006052)

52Then the Jews began to argue among themselves, saying, “How is this one able to give us his flesh to eat?”


## John 6:53 (id: 943006053)

53Therefore, Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you would eat the flesh of the Son of Man and would drink his blood, you do not have life in yourselves.


## John 6:54 (id: 943006054)

54The one eating my flesh and drinking my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up in the last day.


## John 6:55 (id: 943006055)

55For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink.


## John 6:56 (id: 943006056)

56The one eating my flesh and drinking my blood remains in me, and I in him.


## John 6:57 (id: 943006057)

57Just as the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so the one eating me, he will also live because of me.


## John 6:58 (id: 943006058)

58This is the bread that has come down from heaven, not just as the fathers ate and died. The one eating this bread will live into eternity.”


## John 6:59 (id: 943006059)

59He said these things in a synagogue, teaching in Capernaum.


## John 6:60 (id: 943006060)

60Then many of his disciples, having heard, said, “This word is hard; who is able to listen to it?”


## John 6:61 (id: 943006061)

61But Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples were murmuring about this, said to them, “Does this offend you?


## John 6:62 (id: 943006062)

62Then if you would see the Son of Man going up to where he was before…?


## John 6:63 (id: 943006063)

63The Spirit is the one making alive; the flesh profits nothing. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit, and they are life.


## John 6:64 (id: 943006064)

64But there are some of you who do not believe.” For Jesus knew from the beginning who are the ones not believing and who is the one that will be betraying him.


## John 6:65 (id: 943006065)

65And he said, “Because of this, I have said to you that no one is able to come to me unless it would have been granted to him by the Father.”


## John 6:66 (id: 943006066)

66From this {time}, many of his disciples stayed behind and no longer were walking with him.


## John 6:67 (id: 943006067)

67Therefore, Jesus said to the Twelve, “You do not want to go away also, do you?”


## John 6:68 (id: 943006068)

68Simon Peter answered him, “Lord, to whom will we go? You have words of eternal life,


## John 6:69 (id: 943006069)

69and we have believed and have come to know that you are the Holy One of God.”


## John 6:70 (id: 943006070)

70Jesus replied to them, “Did not I choose you, the Twelve, and one of you is a devil?”


## John 6:71 (id: 943006071)

71(Now he was speaking of Judas, {son} of Simon Iscariot, for he, one of the Twelve, was going to betray him.)


## John 7:1 (id: 943007001)

1And after these things, Jesus traveled about in Galilee, for he did not want to walk in Judea, because the Jews were seeking to kill him.


## John 7:2 (id: 943007002)

2(Now the festival of the Jews, the Shelter Festival, was near.)


## John 7:3 (id: 943007003)

3Then his brothers said to him, “Leave this place and go to Judea, so that your disciples also will see your works that you do.


## John 7:4 (id: 943007004)

4For no one does anything in secret and seeks himself to be in openness. If you do these things, show yourself to the world.”


## John 7:5 (id: 943007005)

5For not even his brothers were believing in him.


## John 7:6 (id: 943007006)

6Jesus therefore says to them, “My time is not yet come, but your time is always ready.


## John 7:7 (id: 943007007)

7The world is not able to hate you, but it hates me because I testify about it that the works of it are evil.


## John 7:8 (id: 943007008)

8You go up to the festival; I am not yet going to this festival, because my time has not yet been fulfilled.”


## John 7:9 (id: 943007009)

9Now having said these things to them, he remained in Galilee.


## John 7:10 (id: 943007010)

10But when his brothers had gone up to the festival, then he also went up, not publicly, but as in secret.


## John 7:11 (id: 943007011)

11Therefore, the Jews were looking for him at the festival and saying, “Where is that one?”


## John 7:12 (id: 943007012)

12And there was much murmuring among the crowds about him. Some were saying, “He is good.” But others were saying, “No, but he leads the crowd astray.”


## John 7:13 (id: 943007013)

13However, no one was speaking openly about him, because of the fear of the Jews.


## John 7:14 (id: 943007014)

14Now the festival already being half over, Jesus went up into the temple and began to teach.


## John 7:15 (id: 943007015)

15Therefore, the Jews marveled, saying, “How does this one know letters, not being educated?”


## John 7:16 (id: 943007016)

16Then Jesus answered them and said, “My teaching is not mine, but of the one having sent me.


## John 7:17 (id: 943007017)

17If anyone desires to do his will, he will know about this teaching, whether it is from God, or I speak from myself.


## John 7:18 (id: 943007018)

18The one speaking from himself seeks his own glory, but the one seeking the glory of the one having sent him, this one is true, and there is no unrighteousness in him.


## John 7:19 (id: 943007019)

19Did not Moses give you the law? Yet none of you does the law. Why do you seek to kill me?”


## John 7:20 (id: 943007020)

20The crowd answered, “You have a demon. Who seeks to kill you?”


## John 7:21 (id: 943007021)

21Jesus answered and said to them, “I did one work, and you all marvel.


## John 7:22 (id: 943007022)

22Because of this, Moses has given you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and on the Sabbath you circumcise a man.


## John 7:23 (id: 943007023)

23If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses might not be broken, why are you angry with me because I made a man completely healthy on the Sabbath?


## John 7:24 (id: 943007024)

24Do not judge according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment.”


## John 7:25 (id: 943007025)

25Then some from the Jerusalemites said, “Is not this the one they seek to kill?


## John 7:26 (id: 943007026)

26And see, he speaks openly, and they say nothing to him. The rulers do not truly know that this is the Christ, do they?


## John 7:27 (id: 943007027)

27But we know where this one is from. But when the Christ would come, no one knows where he is from.”


## John 7:28 (id: 943007028)

28Then Jesus cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, “You both know me and know where I am from. And I have not come from myself, but the one having sent me is true, whom you do not know.


## John 7:29 (id: 943007029)

29I know him because I am from him, and he sent me.”


## John 7:30 (id: 943007030)

30Therefore, they were seeking to arrest him, but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come.


## John 7:31 (id: 943007031)

31But many from among the crowd believed in him, and they were saying, “When the Christ may come, he will not do more signs than what this one has done, will he?”


## John 7:32 (id: 943007032)

32The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things about him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers so that they might arrest him.


## John 7:33 (id: 943007033)

33Therefore, Jesus said, “I am still with you for a short time, and then I go away to the one having sent me.


## John 7:34 (id: 943007034)

34You will seek me, but you will not find {me}, and where I am, you will not be able to come.”


## John 7:35 (id: 943007035)

35The Jews therefore said among themselves, “Where is this one about to go that we will not find him? He is not about to go to the dispersion of the Greeks and to teach the Greeks, is he?


## John 7:36 (id: 943007036)

36What is this word that he said, ‘You will seek me, but will not find {me}, and where I am, you will not be able to come’?”


## John 7:37 (id: 943007037)

37But on the last, great day of the festival, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, “If anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink.


## John 7:38 (id: 943007038)

38The one believing in me, just as the scripture says, ‘Rivers of living water will flow from his stomach.’”


## John 7:39 (id: 943007039)

39(Now he said this about the Spirit, whom the ones having believed in him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.)


## John 7:40 (id: 943007040)

40Then some from the crowd, having heard these words, said, “This is truly the Prophet.”


## John 7:41 (id: 943007041)

41Others said, “This is the Christ.” But some said, “Indeed, the Christ does not come from Galilee, does he?


## John 7:42 (id: 943007042)

42Has the Scripture not said that the Christ will come from the seed of David and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?”


## John 7:43 (id: 943007043)

43So a division happened in the crowd because of him.


## John 7:44 (id: 943007044)

44(Now some of them wanted to arrest him, but no one laid hands on him.)


## John 7:45 (id: 943007045)

45Then the officers came back to the chief priests and Pharisees, and those ones said to them, “Why did you not bring him?”


## John 7:46 (id: 943007046)

46The officers answered, “Never has a man spoken like this.”


## John 7:47 (id: 943007047)

47So the Pharisees replied to them, “You have not also been deceived, have you?


## John 7:48 (id: 943007048)

48None from the rulers have believed in him, or from the Pharisees, have they?


## John 7:49 (id: 943007049)

49But this crowd not knowing the law, they are accursed.”


## John 7:50 (id: 943007050)

50Nicodemus (the one having come to him earlier, being one from them) says to them,


## John 7:51 (id: 943007051)

51“Our law does not judge a man unless it first hears from him and knows what he does, does it?”


## John 7:52 (id: 943007052)

52They answered and said to him, “You are not also from Galilee, are you? Search, and see that no prophet rises up from Galilee.”


## John 7:53 (id: 943007053)

53\[Then each went to his {own} house.


## John 8:1 (id: 943008001)

1Now Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.


## John 8:2 (id: 943008002)

2Now early in the morning he came to the temple again, and all the people came to him.


## John 8:3 (id: 943008003)

3Now the scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman caught in adultery, and they placed her in the middle.


## John 8:4 (id: 943008004)

4The priests say to him, testing him in order to have an accusation against him, “Teacher, this woman has been caught in the act of adultery.


## John 8:5 (id: 943008005)

5Now in the law, Moses commanded us to stone such ones, but what do you say now?”


## John 8:6 (id: 943008006)

6But Jesus, having bent down, began to write on the ground with his finger.


## John 8:7 (id: 943008007)

7But when they continued asking him questions, he stood up and said to them, “Let the blameless one among you throw a stone at her first.”


## John 8:8 (id: 943008008)

8And again, having stooped down, he wrote on the ground with his finger.


## John 8:9 (id: 943008009)

9But each of the Jews went out, beginning with the oldest, so that they all went out, and he was left alone, with the woman being in the midst.


## John 8:10 (id: 943008010)

10And Jesus, having stood up, said to the woman, “Where are they? Did no one condemn you?”


## John 8:11 (id: 943008011)

11And she said to him, “No one, Lord.” And he said, “Neither do I condemn you. Go, from now sin no longer.”]


## John 8:12 (id: 943008012)

12Then Jesus again spoke to them, saying, “I am the light of the world; the one following me may certainly not walk in the darkness but will have the light of life.”


## John 8:13 (id: 943008013)

13Then the Pharisees said to him, “You testify about yourself; your testimony is not true.”


## John 8:14 (id: 943008014)

14Jesus answered and said to them, “Even if I testify about myself, my testimony is true. For I know where I came from and where I am going, but you do not know where I came from or where I am going.


## John 8:15 (id: 943008015)

15You judge according to the flesh; I do not judge anyone.


## John 8:16 (id: 943008016)

16But even if I judge, my judgment is true, because I am not alone, but I and the Father having sent me.


## John 8:17 (id: 943008017)

17But even in your law it is written that the testimony of two men is true.


## John 8:18 (id: 943008018)

18I am the one testifying about myself, and the Father having sent me testifies about me.”


## John 8:19 (id: 943008019)

19Therefore, they said to him, “Where is your father?” Jesus answered, “You know neither me nor my Father; if you had known me, you would have known my Father also.”


## John 8:20 (id: 943008020)

20He said these words in the treasury, teaching in the temple, and no one arrested him, because his hour had not yet come.


## John 8:21 (id: 943008021)

21Then again he said to them, “I go away, and you will seek me, and you will die in your sin. Where I go away, you are not able to come.”


## John 8:22 (id: 943008022)

22Then the Jews said, “He will not kill himself, will he? Is that why he says, ‘Where I go, you are not able to come’?”


## John 8:23 (id: 943008023)

23And he said to them, “You are from the things below; I am from the things above. You are from this world; I am not from this world.


## John 8:24 (id: 943008024)

24Therefore, I said to you that you will die in your sins. For unless you believe that I am, you will die in your sins.”


## John 8:25 (id: 943008025)

25Therefore, they said to him, “Who are you?” Jesus said to them, “What have I even been saying to you from the beginning?


## John 8:26 (id: 943008026)

26I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you. But the one having sent me is true; and the things that I heard from him, these things I say to the world.”


## John 8:27 (id: 943008027)

27(They did not understand that he was speaking to them about the Father.)


## John 8:28 (id: 943008028)

28Then Jesus said to them, “When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then will you know that I am, and that I do nothing from myself. But just as the Father taught me, I speak these things.


## John 8:29 (id: 943008029)

29And the one having sent me is with me. He has not left me alone, because I always do what is pleasing to him.”


## John 8:30 (id: 943008030)

30{As} he is speaking these things, many believed in him.


## John 8:31 (id: 943008031)

31Then Jesus said to the Jews having believed in him, “If you remain in my word, you are truly my disciples;


## John 8:32 (id: 943008032)

32and you will know the truth, and the truth will free you.”


## John 8:33 (id: 943008033)

33They replied to him, “We are the seed of Abraham and have never been slaves to anyone; how can you say, ‘You will be free’?”


## John 8:34 (id: 943008034)

34Jesus answered them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, that everyone committing sin is a slave of sin.


## John 8:35 (id: 943008035)

35Now the slave does not remain in the house into eternity; the son remains into eternity.


## John 8:36 (id: 943008036)

36Therefore, if the Son frees you, you will be truly free.


## John 8:37 (id: 943008037)

37I know that you are the seed of Abraham, but you seek to kill me, because my word has no place in you.


## John 8:38 (id: 943008038)

38What I have seen with the Father, I say; and therefore, what you heard from the father, you do.”


## John 8:39 (id: 943008039)

39They answered and said to him, “Our father is Abraham.” Jesus says to them, “If you were children of Abraham, you would do the works of Abraham.


## John 8:40 (id: 943008040)

40But now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do this.


## John 8:41 (id: 943008041)

41You do the works of your father.” Then they said to him, “We have not been born from sexual immorality; we have one Father: God.”


## John 8:42 (id: 943008042)

42Jesus said to them, “If God were your Father, you would have loved me, for I came from God and am here; for neither have I come from myself, but that one sent me.


## John 8:43 (id: 943008043)

43Because of what do you not understand my speech? It is because you are not able to hear my words.


## John 8:44 (id: 943008044)

44You are from your father, the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. That one was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he would speak a lie, he speaks from his own {nature}, because he is a liar and the father of it.


## John 8:45 (id: 943008045)

45But because I speak the truth, you do not believe me.


## John 8:46 (id: 943008046)

46Which one of you convicts me concerning sin? If I speak the truth, why do you not believe me?


## John 8:47 (id: 943008047)

47He who is from God hears the words of God; because of this you do not hear, because you are not from God.”


## John 8:48 (id: 943008048)

48The Jews answered and said to him, “Do we not rightly say that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?”


## John 8:49 (id: 943008049)

49Jesus answered, “I do not have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.


## John 8:50 (id: 943008050)

50Now I do not seek my glory; there is one seeking and judging.


## John 8:51 (id: 943008051)

51Truly, truly, I say to you, if anyone keeps my word, he will certainly not see death into eternity.”


## John 8:52 (id: 943008052)

52The Jews said to him, “Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham and the prophets died; but you say, ‘If anyone keeps my word, he will certainly not taste death into eternity.’


## John 8:53 (id: 943008053)

53You are not greater than our father Abraham who died, are you? The prophets also died. Who do you make yourself out to be?”


## John 8:54 (id: 943008054)

54Jesus answered, “If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing; my Father is the one glorifying me—about whom you say, ‘He is our God.’


## John 8:55 (id: 943008055)

55And you have not known him, but I know him. And if I would say that I do not know him, I would be like you, a liar. However, I know him and keep his word.


## John 8:56 (id: 943008056)

56Your father Abraham rejoiced that he might see my day, and he saw and was glad.”


## John 8:57 (id: 943008057)

57Therefore the Jews said to him, “You do not yet have 50 years, and you have seen Abraham?”


## John 8:58 (id: 943008058)

58Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham came into existence, I am.”


## John 8:59 (id: 943008059)

59Therefore, they picked up stones in order to throw at him, but Jesus hid himself and went out from the temple.


## John 9:1 (id: 943009001)

1And passing by, he saw a man blind from birth.


## John 9:2 (id: 943009002)

2And his disciples asked him, saying, “Rabbi, who sinned, this one or his parents, so that he might be born blind?”


## John 9:3 (id: 943009003)

3Jesus answered, “Neither did this one sin, nor his parents, but so that the works of God might be revealed in him.


## John 9:4 (id: 943009004)

4It is necessary for us to work the works of the one having sent me while it is day. Night is coming when no one is able to work.


## John 9:5 (id: 943009005)

5While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”


## John 9:6 (id: 943009006)

6Having said these things, he spat on the ground and made mud from the saliva and smeared on him the mud on his eyes.


## John 9:7 (id: 943009007)

7And he said to him, “Go, wash in the pool of Siloam,” (which is translated “Sent”). So he went away and washed and came back seeing.


## John 9:8 (id: 943009008)

8Then the neighbors and the ones seeing him previously, that he was a beggar, began saying, “Is not this the one sitting and begging?”


## John 9:9 (id: 943009009)

9Some said, “It is he.” Others said, “Not at all, but that one is like him.” He kept saying, “It is me.”


## John 9:10 (id: 943009010)

10Therefore, they said to him, “How were your eyes opened?”


## John 9:11 (id: 943009011)

11That one answered, “The man called Jesus made mud and smeared {it} on my eyes and said to me, ‘Go to Siloam and wash.’ So having gone and having washed, I received my sight.”


## John 9:12 (id: 943009012)

12And they said to him, “Where is that one?” He said, “I do not know.”


## John 9:13 (id: 943009013)

13They bring him, the one formerly blind, to the Pharisees.


## John 9:14 (id: 943009014)

14(Now it was a Sabbath on the day Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.)


## John 9:15 (id: 943009015)

15Then again the Pharisees also began asking him how he received his sight. But he said to them, “He put mud on my eyes, and I washed, and I see.”


## John 9:16 (id: 943009016)

16Then some of the Pharisees said, “This man is not from God because he does not keep the Sabbath.” Others said, “How is a man, a sinner, able to do such signs?” And there was a division among them.


## John 9:17 (id: 943009017)

17Therefore, they ask the blind man again, “What do you say about him, since he opened your eyes?” And he said, “He is a prophet.”


## John 9:18 (id: 943009018)

18Therefore, the Jews did not believe about him that he was blind and received his sight until they called the parents of him having received sight.


## John 9:19 (id: 943009019)

19And they asked them, saying, “Is this your son, whom you say was born blind? How then does he now see?”


## John 9:20 (id: 943009020)

20So his parents answered and said, “We know that this is our son and that he was born blind.


## John 9:21 (id: 943009021)

21But how he now sees, we do not know, or who opened his eyes, we do not know. Ask him; he has full maturity. He will speak for himself.”


## John 9:22 (id: 943009022)

22His parents said these things because they were afraid of the Jews. For the Jews had already agreed that if anyone would confess him {as} the Christ, he would be put out of the synagogue.


## John 9:23 (id: 943009023)

23Because of this, his parents said, “He has full maturity; ask him.”


## John 9:24 (id: 943009024)

24Therefore, for a second time they called the man who had been blind and said to him, “Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner.”


## John 9:25 (id: 943009025)

25Then that one replied, “I do not know whether he is a sinner. One thing I know: that being blind, now I see.”


## John 9:26 (id: 943009026)

26Then they said to him, “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?”


## John 9:27 (id: 943009027)

27He answered them, “I have told you already, and you did not listen! Why do you want to listen again? You do not want to become his disciples also, do you?”


## John 9:28 (id: 943009028)

28And they reviled him and said, “You are a disciple of that one, but we are disciples of Moses.


## John 9:29 (id: 943009029)

29We know that God has spoken to Moses, but we do not know where this one is from.”


## John 9:30 (id: 943009030)

30The man answered and said to them, “Now this is a remarkable thing, that you do not know where he is from, and yet he opened my eyes.


## John 9:31 (id: 943009031)

31We know that God does not hear sinners, but if someone is devout and does his will, he hears this one.


## John 9:32 (id: 943009032)

32From eternity it has never been heard that anyone opened the eyes of one having been born blind.


## John 9:33 (id: 943009033)

33If this one were not from God, he would not be able to do anything.”


## John 9:34 (id: 943009034)

34They answered and said to him, “You were completely born in sins, and you are teaching us?” And they put him out.


## John 9:35 (id: 943009035)

35Jesus heard that they had put him out, and having found him, he said, “Do you believe in the Son of Man?”


## John 9:36 (id: 943009036)

36That one replied and said, “And who is he, sir, so that I might believe in him?”


## John 9:37 (id: 943009037)

37Jesus said to him, “You have both seen him, and that one is the one speaking with you.”


## John 9:38 (id: 943009038)

38Now he said, “Lord, I believe” and he worshiped him.


## John 9:39 (id: 943009039)

39And Jesus said, “For judgment I came into this world, so that those not seeing might see and those seeing might become blind.”


## John 9:40 (id: 943009040)

40{Some} of the Pharisees being with him heard these things and asked him, “We are not also blind, are we?”


## John 9:41 (id: 943009041)

41Jesus said to them, “If you were blind, you would have no sin, but now you say, ‘We see.’ Your sin remains.”


## John 10:1 (id: 943010001)

1“Truly, truly, I say to you, the one not entering through the gate into the sheep pen but climbing up some other way, that one is a thief and a robber.


## John 10:2 (id: 943010002)

2But the one entering through the gate is the shepherd of the sheep.


## John 10:3 (id: 943010003)

3The gatekeeper opens for this one, and the sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.


## John 10:4 (id: 943010004)

4When he has brought out all his own, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice.


## John 10:5 (id: 943010005)

5Now they will certainly not follow a stranger, but they will flee from him, for they do not know the voice of strangers.”


## John 10:6 (id: 943010006)

6Jesus spoke this parable to them, but those ones did not understand what it was that he was saying to them.


## John 10:7 (id: 943010007)

7Therefore, Jesus said to them again, “Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the gate of the sheep.


## John 10:8 (id: 943010008)

8Everyone who came before me is a thief and a robber, but the sheep did not hear them.


## John 10:9 (id: 943010009)

9I am the gate. If anyone enters through me, he will be saved, and he will go in and go out and will find pasture.


## John 10:10 (id: 943010010)

10The thief does not come except in order that he might steal and kill and destroy. I have come so that they might have life and might have it abundantly.


## John 10:11 (id: 943010011)

11I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.


## John 10:12 (id: 943010012)

12And the hired man, not being a shepherd, of whom the sheep are not his own, sees the wolf coming and abandons the sheep and escapes, and the wolf seizes and scatters them,


## John 10:13 (id: 943010013)

13because he is a hired man, and it is not a concern to him about the sheep.


## John 10:14 (id: 943010014)

14I am the good shepherd, and I know the ones of mine, and the ones of mine know me,


## John 10:15 (id: 943010015)

15just as the Father knows me, and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep.


## John 10:16 (id: 943010016)

16And I have other sheep that are not from this sheep pen. It is necessary for me to bring them also, and they will hear my voice and there will be one flock, one shepherd.


## John 10:17 (id: 943010017)

17Because of this the Father loves me, because I lay down my life so that I might take it up again.


## John 10:18 (id: 943010018)

18No one takes it away from me, but I lay it down from myself. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it up again. I received this command from my Father.”


## John 10:19 (id: 943010019)

19A division again occurred among the Jews because of these words.


## John 10:20 (id: 943010020)

20Now many of them were saying, “He has a demon and is insane. Why do you listen to him?”


## John 10:21 (id: 943010021)

21Others were saying, “These are not the words of a demon\-possessed man. A demon is not able to open the eyes of the blind, is he?”


## John 10:22 (id: 943010022)

22Then the Festival of Dedication in Jerusalem happened. It was winter,


## John 10:23 (id: 943010023)

23and Jesus was walking in the temple on the porch of Solomon.


## John 10:24 (id: 943010024)

24Then the Jews surrounded him and began saying to him, “How long are you taking away our life? If you are the Christ, tell us openly.”


## John 10:25 (id: 943010025)

25Jesus replied to them, “I told you, but you do not believe. The works that I do in the name of my Father, these testify concerning me.


## John 10:26 (id: 943010026)

26But you do not believe, because you are not from my sheep.


## John 10:27 (id: 943010027)

27My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.


## John 10:28 (id: 943010028)

28And I give them eternal life, and they will certainly not perish into eternity, and no one will snatch any of them from my hand.


## John 10:29 (id: 943010029)

29My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them from the hand of the Father.


## John 10:30 (id: 943010030)

30I and the Father are one.”


## John 10:31 (id: 943010031)

31The Jews took up stones again so that they might stone him.


## John 10:32 (id: 943010032)

32Jesus answered them, “I have shown you many good works from the Father. For which of those works are you stoning me?”


## John 10:33 (id: 943010033)

33The Jews answered him, “We are not stoning you for a good work, but for blasphemy, and because you, a man, are making yourself God.”


## John 10:34 (id: 943010034)

34Jesus answered them, “Is it not written in your law, ‘I said, “You are gods”’?


## John 10:35 (id: 943010035)

35If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came (and the Scripture is not able to be broken),


## John 10:36 (id: 943010036)

36do you say to the one the Father sanctified and sent into the world, ‘You are blaspheming,’ because I said, ‘I am the Son of God’?


## John 10:37 (id: 943010037)

37If I am not doing the works of my Father, do not believe me.


## John 10:38 (id: 943010038)

38But if I am doing them, even if you do not believe me, believe in the works so that you might know and might understand that the Father {is} in me, and I in the Father.”


## John 10:39 (id: 943010039)

39Therefore, they were seeking to seize him again, but he went away out of their hand.


## John 10:40 (id: 943010040)

40And he went away again beyond the Jordan to the place where John first was baptizing, and he stayed there.


## John 10:41 (id: 943010041)

41And many came to him and were saying, “John indeed did no sign, but all that John said about this one was true.”


## John 10:42 (id: 943010042)

42And many believed in him there.


## John 11:1 (id: 943011001)

1Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus from Bethany, from the village of Mary and her sister Martha.


## John 11:2 (id: 943011002)

2Now Mary was the one having anointed the Lord with myrrh and having wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.


## John 11:3 (id: 943011003)

3Therefore, the sisters sent to him, saying, “Sir, behold, he whom you love is sick.”


## John 11:4 (id: 943011004)

4But having heard {it}, Jesus said, “This sickness is not to death but for the glory of God so that the Son of God may be glorified by it.”


## John 11:5 (id: 943011005)

5(Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.)


## John 11:6 (id: 943011006)

6Therefore, when he heard that he was sick, he then indeed stayed two days in the place where he was.


## John 11:7 (id: 943011007)

7Then after this, he says to the disciples, “Let us go to Judea again.”


## John 11:8 (id: 943011008)

8The disciples say to him, “Rabbi, right now the Jews are seeking to stone you, and you are going back there again?”


## John 11:9 (id: 943011009)

9Jesus answered, “Are there not 12 hours in the day? If someone walks in the daytime, he does not stumble, because he sees by the light of this world.


## John 11:10 (id: 943011010)

10But if someone walks at night, he stumbles because the light is not in him.”


## John 11:11 (id: 943011011)

11He said these things, and after this, he says to them, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I am going so that I may wake him out of sleep.”


## John 11:12 (id: 943011012)

12Therefore, the disciples said to him, “Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.”


## John 11:13 (id: 943011013)

13(Now Jesus had spoken about his death, but those ones thought that he is speaking about the sleep of slumber.)


## John 11:14 (id: 943011014)

14Therefore, Jesus then said to them plainly, “Lazarus died.


## John 11:15 (id: 943011015)

15And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.”


## John 11:16 (id: 943011016)

16Therefore, Thomas, called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples, “Let us also go, so that we may die with him.”


## John 11:17 (id: 943011017)

17Therefore, having come, Jesus found him having already been in the tomb for four days.


## John 11:18 (id: 943011018)

18Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about 15 stadia away.


## John 11:19 (id: 943011019)

19And many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary so that they might comfort them about their brother.


## John 11:20 (id: 943011020)

20Then Martha, when she heard, “Jesus is coming,” went to meet him, but Mary was sitting in the house.


## John 11:21 (id: 943011021)

21Martha then said to Jesus, “Lord, if you were here, my brother would not have died.


## John 11:22 (id: 943011022)

22But even now, I know that whatever you would ask from God, God will give to you.”


## John 11:23 (id: 943011023)

23Jesus says to her, “Your brother will rise again.”


## John 11:24 (id: 943011024)

24Martha says to him, “I know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day.”


## John 11:25 (id: 943011025)

25Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life; the one believing in me, even if he dies, will live;


## John 11:26 (id: 943011026)

26and everyone living and believing in me may certainly not die into eternity. Do you believe this?”


## John 11:27 (id: 943011027)

27She says to him, “Yes, Lord, I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, coming into the world.”


## John 11:28 (id: 943011028)

28And having said this, she went away and called her sister Mary privately, having said, “The Teacher is here and is calling you.”


## John 11:29 (id: 943011029)

29Now when she heard this, she got up quickly and went to him.


## John 11:30 (id: 943011030)

30(Now Jesus had not yet come into the village but was still in the place where Martha had met him.)


## John 11:31 (id: 943011031)

31Then the Jews being with her in the house and comforting her, having seen that Mary got up quickly and went out, followed her, having thought that she was going to the tomb so that she might weep there.


## John 11:32 (id: 943011032)

32Then as soon as Mary came {to the place} where Jesus was, having seen him, she fell down at his feet, saying to him, “Lord, if you were here, my brother would not have died.”


## John 11:33 (id: 943011033)

33When therefore Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews having come with her weeping, he was deeply disturbed in the spirit and he troubled himself.


## John 11:34 (id: 943011034)

34And he said, “Where have you laid him?” They say to him, “Lord, come and see.”


## John 11:35 (id: 943011035)

35Jesus wept.


## John 11:36 (id: 943011036)

36Then the Jews said, “Behold how much he loved him!”


## John 11:37 (id: 943011037)

37But some of them said, “Was this one, having opened the eyes of the blind man, not able to act so that this one also would not die?”


## John 11:38 (id: 943011038)

38Therefore, Jesus again, being deeply disturbed in himself, went to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay against it.


## John 11:39 (id: 943011039)

39Jesus says, “Take away the stone.” Martha, the sister of the one that had died, says to him, “Lord, he will already stink, for it is four days.”


## John 11:40 (id: 943011040)

40Jesus says to her, “Did I not say to you that, if you believe, you will see the glory of God?”


## John 11:41 (id: 943011041)

41Therefore, they took away the stone. Then Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, “Father, I thank you that you heard me.


## John 11:42 (id: 943011042)

42Now I have known that you always hear, but because of the crowd that is standing around I spoke, so that they may believe that you sent me.”


## John 11:43 (id: 943011043)

43And having said this, he cried out with a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out!”


## John 11:44 (id: 943011044)

44The dead man came out, his feet and hands having been bound with cloths, and his face having been bound with a cloth. Jesus says to them, “Untie him, and let him go.”


## John 11:45 (id: 943011045)

45Therefore, many of the Jews, having come to Mary and having seen what he did, believed in him.


## John 11:46 (id: 943011046)

46But some of them went away to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.


## John 11:47 (id: 943011047)

47Therefore, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered the Sanhedrin together and said, “What will we do, for this man does many signs?


## John 11:48 (id: 943011048)

48If we leave him alone like this, all will believe in him, and the Romans will come and will take away both our place and nation.”


## John 11:49 (id: 943011049)

49But one certain man among them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said to them, “You do not know anything.


## John 11:50 (id: 943011050)

50You do not consider that it is better for you that one man would die for the people, and the whole nation would not perish.”


## John 11:51 (id: 943011051)

51(Now this he said not from himself, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation,


## John 11:52 (id: 943011052)

52and not only for the nation, but so that also the children of God having been scattered would be gathered together into one.)


## John 11:53 (id: 943011053)

53Therefore, from that day they plotted so that they might put him to death.


## John 11:54 (id: 943011054)

54Therefore, Jesus no longer walked openly among the Jews, but he departed from there into the country near the wilderness, into a town called Ephraim. There he stayed with the disciples.


## John 11:55 (id: 943011055)

55Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and many went up to Jerusalem from the country before the Passover so that they might purify themselves.


## John 11:56 (id: 943011056)

56So they were looking for Jesus and speaking one with another as they stood in the temple, “What does it seem to you? That he may certainly not come to the festival?”


## John 11:57 (id: 943011057)

57Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given an order so that if anyone might know where he was, he should report it so that they might seize him.


## John 12:1 (id: 943012001)

1Then, six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead.


## John 12:2 (id: 943012002)

2So they made him a dinner there, and Martha was serving, but Lazarus was one of the ones reclining to eat with him.


## John 12:3 (id: 943012003)

3Then Mary, having taken a litra of perfumed oil of very precious pure nard, anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair. Now the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfumed oil.


## John 12:4 (id: 943012004)

4But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, the one going to betray him, says,


## John 12:5 (id: 943012005)

5“For what reason was this perfumed oil not sold for 300 denarii and given to the poor?”


## John 12:6 (id: 943012006)

6(Now he said this, not because it was a concern to him about the poor, but because he was a thief, and having the moneybag, he was stealing the things being put in it.)


## John 12:7 (id: 943012007)

7Therefore Jesus said, “Leave her alone so that she might have kept it for the day of my burial.


## John 12:8 (id: 943012008)

8For you always have the poor with you, but you do not always have me.”


## John 12:9 (id: 943012009)

9Then a large crowd of the Jews learned that he is there, and they came, not only for Jesus, but also so that they might see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.


## John 12:10 (id: 943012010)

10But the chief priests plotted so that they might also put Lazarus to death;


## John 12:11 (id: 943012011)

11for because of him many of the Jews went away and believed in Jesus.


## John 12:12 (id: 943012012)

12On the next day the great crowd, the one having come to the festival, having heard that Jesus is coming to Jerusalem,


## John 12:13 (id: 943012013)

13took the branches of the palm trees and went out to meet him and cried out, “Hosanna! Blessed {is} the one coming in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel.”


## John 12:14 (id: 943012014)

14Now Jesus, having found a young donkey, sat on it, just as it is written,


## John 12:15 (id: 943012015)

15“Do not fear, daughter of Zion; behold, your King is coming, sitting on a colt of a donkey.”


## John 12:16 (id: 943012016)

16His disciples did not understand these things at first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things had been written about him and that they had done these things to him.


## John 12:17 (id: 943012017)

17Then testified the crowd being with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him up from the dead.


## John 12:18 (id: 943012018)

18Because of this also the crowd went out to meet him: because they heard that he had done this sign.


## John 12:19 (id: 943012019)

19Therefore, the Pharisees said among themselves, “You see that you are accomplishing nothing! Behold, the world has gone after him!”


## John 12:20 (id: 943012020)

20Now certain Greeks were among the ones going up so that they might worship at the festival.


## John 12:21 (id: 943012021)

21Then these men went to Philip, the one from Bethsaida in Galilee, and asked him, saying, “Sir, we want to see Jesus.”


## John 12:22 (id: 943012022)

22Philip goes and speaks to Andrew; Andrew and Philip go and speak to Jesus.


## John 12:23 (id: 943012023)

23Now Jesus answers them, saying, “The hour has come so that the Son of Man might be glorified.


## John 12:24 (id: 943012024)

24Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat, having fallen into the earth, dies, it remains by itself; but if it would die, it bears much fruit.


## John 12:25 (id: 943012025)

25The one loving his life loses it, but the one hating his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.


## John 12:26 (id: 943012026)

26If anyone would serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there will my servant also be. If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him.


## John 12:27 (id: 943012027)

27Now my soul has been troubled, and what might I say? ‘Father, save me from this hour’? But because of this I came to this hour.


## John 12:28 (id: 943012028)

28Father, glorify your name.” Then a voice came from heaven, “I have both glorified {it}, and I will glorify {it} again.”


## John 12:29 (id: 943012029)

29Then the crowd that had stood by, also having heard it, were saying that thunder had occurred. Others were saying, “An angel has spoken to him.”


## John 12:30 (id: 943012030)

30Jesus answered and said, “This voice did not come for me, but for you.


## John 12:31 (id: 943012031)

31Now is the judgment of this world: Now will the ruler of this world be thrown out.


## John 12:32 (id: 943012032)

32And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw everyone to myself.”


## John 12:33 (id: 943012033)

33Now he was saying this to indicate what kind of death he was about to die.


## John 12:34 (id: 943012034)

34Then the crowd answered him, “We have heard from the law that the Christ remains into eternity. And how do you say that it is necessary for the Son of Man to be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?”


## John 12:35 (id: 943012035)

35Jesus then said to them, “The light will be with you yet a short time. Walk while you have the light, so that darkness might not overtake you. And the one walking in the darkness does not know where he goes.


## John 12:36 (id: 943012036)

36While you have the light, believe in the light so that you may be sons of light.” Jesus said these things, and having departed, was hidden from them.


## John 12:37 (id: 943012037)

37Although he had done so many signs before them, they were not believing in him


## John 12:38 (id: 943012038)

38so that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, in which he said: “Lord, who has believed our report, and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?”


## John 12:39 (id: 943012039)

39Because of this they were not able to believe, for Isaiah had again said,


## John 12:40 (id: 943012040)

40“He has blinded their eyes, and he has hardened their heart; so that they might not see with their eyes and might understand with their heart, and might turn, and I will heal them.”


## John 12:41 (id: 943012041)

41Isaiah said these things because he saw his glory and spoke about him.


## John 12:42 (id: 943012042)

42But nevertheless, even many of the rulers believed in him; but because of the Pharisees, they were not confessing {it} so that they would not be put out of the synagogue.


## John 12:43 (id: 943012043)

43For they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God.


## John 12:44 (id: 943012044)

44Now Jesus cried out and said, “The one believing in me believes not only in me but also in the one having sent me,


## John 12:45 (id: 943012045)

45and the one seeing me sees the one having sent me.


## John 12:46 (id: 943012046)

46I have come {as} a light to the world, so that everyone believing in me might not remain in the darkness.


## John 12:47 (id: 943012047)

47And if anyone hears my words but does not keep {them}, I do not judge him; for I have not come so that I might judge the world, but so that I might save the world.


## John 12:48 (id: 943012048)

48The one rejecting me and not receiving my words has one judging him. The word which I have spoken, this will judge him on the last day.


## John 12:49 (id: 943012049)

49For I did not speak from myself, but the Father himself, having sent me, has given me a command, what I should say and what I should speak.


## John 12:50 (id: 943012050)

50And I know that his command is eternal life. Therefore, what I say, just as the Father has spoken to me, thus I speak.”


## John 13:1 (id: 943013001)

1Now before the Festival of the Passover, Jesus knew that his hour had come so that he might depart from this world to the Father. Having loved his own in the world, he loved them to the end.


## John 13:2 (id: 943013002)

2And supper happening, the devil having already put into the heart of Judas, {son} of Simon Iscariot, so that he might betray him,


## John 13:3 (id: 943013003)

3knowing that the Father had given all things to him, into his hands, and that he had come from God and was going back to God,


## John 13:4 (id: 943013004)

4he gets up from supper and takes off his outer clothing. And having taken a towel, he wrapped {it} around himself.


## John 13:5 (id: 943013005)

5Then he pours water into a basin and began to wash the feet of the disciples and to dry them with the towel that was tied around himself.


## John 13:6 (id: 943013006)

6Then he comes to Simon Peter. He says to him, “Lord, do you wash my feet?”


## John 13:7 (id: 943013007)

7Jesus answered and said to him, “What I do you do not understand now, but you will understand after these things.”


## John 13:8 (id: 943013008)

8Peter says to him, “You may certainly not wash my feet into eternity.” Jesus answered him, “If I do not wash you, you have no share with me.”


## John 13:9 (id: 943013009)

9Simon Peter says to him, “Lord, not only my feet, but also my hands and my head.”


## John 13:10 (id: 943013010)

10Jesus says to him, “The one that has been washed has no need, except to wash his feet, but he is completely clean, and you are clean, but not all.”


## John 13:11 (id: 943013011)

11(For he knew the one betraying him; because of this he said, “Not all are clean.”)


## John 13:12 (id: 943013012)

12So when he had washed their feet and taken his garments and sat down again, he said to them, “Do you understand what I have done for you?


## John 13:13 (id: 943013013)

13You call me ‘The Teacher’ and ‘The Lord,’ and you are speaking correctly, because I am.


## John 13:14 (id: 943013014)

14If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash the feet of one another.


## John 13:15 (id: 943013015)

15For I have given you an example so that you also would do just as I did to you.


## John 13:16 (id: 943013016)

16Truly, truly, I say to you, a slave is not greater than his master, nor {is} a messenger greater than the one having sent him.


## John 13:17 (id: 943013017)

17If you know these things, you are blessed if you do them.


## John 13:18 (id: 943013018)

18I am not speaking about all of you; I know whom I have chosen—but so that the scripture might be fulfilled: ‘The one eating bread with me lifted up his heel against me.’


## John 13:19 (id: 943013019)

19From this moment I tell you, before it happens, so that when it happens, you may believe that I am.


## John 13:20 (id: 943013020)

20Truly, truly, I say to you, the one receiving whomever I might send receives me, and the one receiving me receives the one having sent me.”


## John 13:21 (id: 943013021)

21Having said this, Jesus was troubled in spirit, and he testified and said, “Truly, truly, I say to you that one of you will betray me.”


## John 13:22 (id: 943013022)

22The disciples began looking at each other, wondering about whom he was speaking.


## John 13:23 (id: 943013023)

23Now one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, was reclining to eat against the chest of Jesus.


## John 13:24 (id: 943013024)

24Therefore, Simon Peter motioned to this one to ask, “Who is it about whom he is speaking?”


## John 13:25 (id: 943013025)

25So having thus leaned back against the chest of Jesus, that one says to him, “Lord, who is it?”


## John 13:26 (id: 943013026)

26Jesus answered, “It is that one to whom I, having dipped the piece of bread, will hand it over and give it to him.” Then having dipped the bread, he gave {it} to Judas, {son} of Simon Iscariot.


## John 13:27 (id: 943013027)

27And after the bread, Satan then entered into him. Therefore, Jesus says to him, “What you are doing, do quickly.”


## John 13:28 (id: 943013028)

28(Now none of the ones reclining to eat knew why he said this to him.


## John 13:29 (id: 943013029)

29For some were thinking, since Judas had the moneybag, that Jesus says to him, “Buy the things we need to have for the festival,” or so that he might give something to the poor.)


## John 13:30 (id: 943013030)

30Therefore, having received the bread, he went out immediately. Now it was night.


## John 13:31 (id: 943013031)

31Therefore, when he had gone out, Jesus says, “Now the Son of Man has been glorified, and God has been glorified in him.


## John 13:32 (id: 943013032)

32And God will glorify him in himself, and he will glorify him immediately.


## John 13:33 (id: 943013033)

33Little children, I am with you for still a short time. You will seek me, and just as I said to the Jews, ‘Where I go, you are not able to come.’ Now I also say this to you.


## John 13:34 (id: 943013034)

34I give to you a new commandment, so that you would love one another; just as I have loved you, so also you would love one another.


## John 13:35 (id: 943013035)

35By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love one for another.”


## John 13:36 (id: 943013036)

36Simon Peter says to him, “Lord, where are you going?” Jesus answered him, “Where I go, you are not able to follow me now, but you will follow later.”


## John 13:37 (id: 943013037)

37Peter says to him, “Lord, why am I not able to follow you now? I will lay down my life for you.”


## John 13:38 (id: 943013038)

38Jesus answered, “Will you lay down your life for me? Truly, truly, I say to you, the rooster may certainly not crow before which you will deny me three times.”


## John 14:1 (id: 943014001)

1“Do not let your heart be troubled. Believe in God; believe also in me.


## John 14:2 (id: 943014002)

2In the house of my Father are many dwelling places. But if not, I would have told you, for I am going to prepare a place for you.


## John 14:3 (id: 943014003)

3And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to myself, so that where I am you also may be.


## John 14:4 (id: 943014004)

4And you know the way where I am going.”


## John 14:5 (id: 943014005)

5Thomas says to him, “Lord, we do not know where you are going. How are we able to know the way?”


## John 14:6 (id: 943014006)

6Jesus says to him, “I am the way and the truth and the life; no one comes to the Father except through me.


## John 14:7 (id: 943014007)

7If you have known me, you will know my Father also. And from now on you know him and have seen him.”


## John 14:8 (id: 943014008)

8Philip says to him, “Lord, show us the Father, and that will be enough for us.”


## John 14:9 (id: 943014009)

9Jesus says to him, “So long a time I am with you, and you do not know me, Philip? The one that has seen me has seen the Father. How do you say, ‘Show us the Father’?


## John 14:10 (id: 943014010)

10Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak from myself, but the Father remaining in me is doing his work.


## John 14:11 (id: 943014011)

11Believe me that I {am} in the Father, and the Father {is} in me. But if not, believe because of the works themselves.


## John 14:12 (id: 943014012)

12Truly, truly, I say to you, the one believing in me, the works that I do, he also will do, and he will do greater than these, because I am going to the Father.


## John 14:13 (id: 943014013)

13And whatever you ask in my name, this I will do so that the Father may be glorified in the Son.


## John 14:14 (id: 943014014)

14If you ask me anything in my name, I will do it.


## John 14:15 (id: 943014015)

15If you love me, you will keep my commandments,


## John 14:16 (id: 943014016)

16and I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Helper so that he may be with you into eternity—


## John 14:17 (id: 943014017)

17the Spirit of Truth whom the world is not able to receive, because it does not see him nor know him. You know him, for he remains with you and will be in you.


## John 14:18 (id: 943014018)

18I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you.


## John 14:19 (id: 943014019)

19Yet a short time and the world no longer sees me, but you see me. Because I live, you will also live.


## John 14:20 (id: 943014020)

20In that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you {are} in me, and I {am} in you.


## John 14:21 (id: 943014021)

21The one having my commandments and keeping them, this is the one loving me, and the one loving me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and I will show myself to him.”


## John 14:22 (id: 943014022)

22Judas (not Iscariot) says to him, “Lord, what has happened that you are about to show yourself to us and not to the world?”


## John 14:23 (id: 943014023)

23Jesus answered and said to him, “If anyone loves me, he will keep my word. And my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and we will make a dwelling place with him.


## John 14:24 (id: 943014024)

24The one not loving me does not keep my words. And the word that you hear is not mine, but of the Father having sent me.


## John 14:25 (id: 943014025)

25I have said these things to you, remaining with you.


## John 14:26 (id: 943014026)

26Now the Helper—the Holy Spirit whom the Father will send in my name—he will teach you everything, and he will remind you of everything that I said to you.


## John 14:27 (id: 943014027)

27I leave you peace; I give you my peace. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your heart be troubled, nor let it be afraid.


## John 14:28 (id: 943014028)

28You heard that I said to you, ‘I am going away, and I will come to you.’ If you loved me, you would be glad because I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I am.


## John 14:29 (id: 943014029)

29And now I have told you before it happens so that, when it may happen, you will believe.


## John 14:30 (id: 943014030)

30I will no longer speak many things with you, for the ruler of the world is coming. And he has nothing in me,


## John 14:31 (id: 943014031)

31but so that the world might know that I love the Father, and just as the Father commanded me, thus I do. Get up. Let us go from here.”


## John 15:1 (id: 943015001)

1“I am the true vine, and my Father is the farmer.


## John 15:2 (id: 943015002)

2Every branch in me not bearing fruit, he takes it away; and every one that bears fruit, he prunes it so that it might bear more fruit.


## John 15:3 (id: 943015003)

3You are already clean through the word that I have spoken to you.


## John 15:4 (id: 943015004)

4Remain in me, and I in you. Just as a branch is not able to bear fruit from itself unless it remains in the vine, so neither can you, unless you remain in me.


## John 15:5 (id: 943015005)

5I am the vine; you {are} the branches. The one remaining in me and I in him, he bears much fruit, for without me you can do nothing.


## John 15:6 (id: 943015006)

6If anyone does not remain in me, he is thrown outside like a branch and is dried up, and they gather them and throw {them} into the fire, and they are burned up.


## John 15:7 (id: 943015007)

7If you remain in me, and my words remain in you, ask whatever you desire, and it will be done for you.


## John 15:8 (id: 943015008)

8My Father was glorified in this, that you would bear much fruit and you would be my disciples.


## John 15:9 (id: 943015009)

9Just as the Father has loved me, I have also loved you. Remain in my love.


## John 15:10 (id: 943015010)

10If you keep my commandments, you will remain in my love, just as I have kept the commandments of the Father and remain in his love.


## John 15:11 (id: 943015011)

11I have spoken these things to you so that my joy might be in you and your joy might be complete.


## John 15:12 (id: 943015012)

12This is my commandment, that you would love one another just as I have loved you.


## John 15:13 (id: 943015013)

13No one has greater love than this—that he would lay down his life for his friends.


## John 15:14 (id: 943015014)

14You are my friends if you do what I command you.


## John 15:15 (id: 943015015)

15No longer do I call you servants, for the servant does not know what his master is doing. But I have called you friends, for all the things I heard from my Father, I have made known to you.


## John 15:16 (id: 943015016)

16You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you so that you would go and would bear fruit, and your fruit would remain, so that whatever you would ask of the Father in my name, he would give it to you.


## John 15:17 (id: 943015017)

17These things I command you so that you would love one another.


## John 15:18 (id: 943015018)

18If the world hates you, know that it has hated me before you.


## John 15:19 (id: 943015019)

19If you were from the world, the world would love its own. But because you are not from the world, but I chose you from the world, on account of this the world hates you.


## John 15:20 (id: 943015020)

20Remember the word that I said to you, ‘A slave is not greater than his master.’ If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they kept my word, they will also keep yours.


## John 15:21 (id: 943015021)

21But they will do all these things to you because of my name, because they do not know the one having sent me.


## John 15:22 (id: 943015022)

22If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have sin, but now they have no excuse for their sin.


## John 15:23 (id: 943015023)

23The one hating me also hates my Father.


## John 15:24 (id: 943015024)

24If I had not done the works that no one else did among them, they would have no sin, but now they have both seen and hated both me and my Father.


## John 15:25 (id: 943015025)

25But this is so that the word that is written in their law might be fulfilled, ‘They hated me without a cause.’


## John 15:26 (id: 943015026)

26When the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father—the Spirit of Truth who goes out from the Father—he will testify about me.


## John 15:27 (id: 943015027)

27But you also testify because you are with me from the beginning.”


## John 16:1 (id: 943016001)

1“I have spoken these things to you so that you might not fall away.


## John 16:2 (id: 943016002)

2They will cause you to be put out of the synagogues. But an hour is coming for everyone having killed you to think he offers a service to God.


## John 16:3 (id: 943016003)

3And they will do these things because they have not known the Father, nor me.


## John 16:4 (id: 943016004)

4But I have spoken these things to you so that when their hour comes, you may remember that I told you about them. But I did not tell you these things in the beginning, because I was with you.


## John 16:5 (id: 943016005)

5But now I go to the one having sent me, and none of you asks me, ‘Where are you going?’


## John 16:6 (id: 943016006)

6But because I have said these things to you, sadness has filled your heart.


## John 16:7 (id: 943016007)

7But I tell you the truth, it is better for you that I would go away. For if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you.


## John 16:8 (id: 943016008)

8And having come, that one will reprove the world about sin and about righteousness and about judgment—


## John 16:9 (id: 943016009)

9about sin, because they do not believe in me;


## John 16:10 (id: 943016010)

10and about righteousness, because I go to the Father, and you will no longer see me;


## John 16:11 (id: 943016011)

11and about judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged.


## John 16:12 (id: 943016012)

12I have many more things to say to you, but you are not able to bear {them} now.


## John 16:13 (id: 943016013)

13But when that one, the Spirit of Truth, comes, he will guide you into the whole truth, for he will not speak from himself, but he will say whatever he will hear, and he will announce to you the things coming.


## John 16:14 (id: 943016014)

14That one will glorify me, because he will take from the things of mine, and he will announce {it} to you.


## John 16:15 (id: 943016015)

15Everything, as much as the Father has, is mine. Therefore, I said that he will take from the things of mine and he will announce {it} to you.


## John 16:16 (id: 943016016)

16And in a little {while} you no longer see me, and again a little {while} and you will see me.”


## John 16:17 (id: 943016017)

17Then some of his disciples said to one another, “What is this that he says to us, ‘A little {while} and you do not see me, and again a little {while} and you will see me,’ and, ‘Because I go to the Father’?”


## John 16:18 (id: 943016018)

18Therefore they were saying, “What is this ‘A little {while}’? We do not know what he is saying.”


## John 16:19 (id: 943016019)

19Jesus knew that they wanted to question him, and he said to them, “Are you seeking among yourselves concerning this, that I said, ‘A little {while} and you do not see me, and again a little {while} and you will see me’?


## John 16:20 (id: 943016020)

20Truly, truly, I say to you that you will weep and lament, but the world will be glad. You will be grieved, but your sorrow will become joy.


## John 16:21 (id: 943016021)

21When a woman gives birth, she has pain because her hour has come, but when she has given birth to the child, she no longer remembers her suffering, because of the joy that a man has been born into the world.


## John 16:22 (id: 943016022)

22And so you have sorrow now, but I will see you again, and your heart will be glad, and no one takes away your joy from you.


## John 16:23 (id: 943016023)

23And in that day you will ask me nothing. Truly, truly, I say to you, whatever you ask of the Father in my name, he will give {it} to you.


## John 16:24 (id: 943016024)

24Until now you have asked nothing in my name. Ask, and you will receive so that your joy may be fulfilled.


## John 16:25 (id: 943016025)

25I have said these things to you in figures of speech; an hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures of speech, but instead I will tell you plainly about the Father.


## John 16:26 (id: 943016026)

26In that day you will ask in my name, and I do not say to you that I will ask the Father on behalf of you,


## John 16:27 (id: 943016027)

27for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God.


## John 16:28 (id: 943016028)

28I came from the Father, and I have come into the world. Again, I am leaving the world, and I am going to the Father.”


## John 16:29 (id: 943016029)

29His disciples say, “See, now you are speaking plainly, and you are not speaking in figures of speech.


## John 16:30 (id: 943016030)

30Now we know that you know all things, and you do not have need that anyone would question you. In this we believe that you have come from God.”


## John 16:31 (id: 943016031)

31Jesus answered them, “Just now do you believe?


## John 16:32 (id: 943016032)

32Behold, an hour is coming—and has come—that you might be scattered, each one to his own, and you might leave me alone. Yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.


## John 16:33 (id: 943016033)

33I have spoken these things to you so that you might have peace in me. In the world you have troubles, but have courage. I have conquered the world.”


## John 17:1 (id: 943017001)

1Jesus said these things and, having lifted up his eyes to the heaven, he said, “Father, the hour has come. Glorify your Son so that the Son might glorify you,


## John 17:2 (id: 943017002)

2since you gave him authority {over} all flesh so that everyone whom you have given him, he would give to them eternal life.


## John 17:3 (id: 943017003)

3Now this is eternal life, that they would know you, the only true God, and the one you sent, Jesus Christ.


## John 17:4 (id: 943017004)

4I glorified you on the earth, having completed the work that you have given me so that I might do it.


## John 17:5 (id: 943017005)

5And now, Father, glorify me along with yourself with the glory that I had with you before the world was made.


## John 17:6 (id: 943017006)

6I revealed your name to the men whom you gave me from the world. They were yours, and you gave them to me, and they have kept your word.


## John 17:7 (id: 943017007)

7Now they know that everything that you have given me is from you,


## John 17:8 (id: 943017008)

8for I have given them the words that you gave me, and they received {them} and truly knew that I came from you, and they believed that you sent me.


## John 17:9 (id: 943017009)

9I ask on behalf of them. I do not ask on behalf of the world, but on behalf of whom you have given me, for they are yours.


## John 17:10 (id: 943017010)

10And all my things are yours, and your things {are} mine, and I am glorified in them.


## John 17:11 (id: 943017011)

11And I am no longer in the world, but they are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep them in your name that you have given me so that they would be one, just as we are.


## John 17:12 (id: 943017012)

12While I was with them, I kept them in your name that you have given me. And I protected them, and not one of them perished, except for the son of destruction, so that the scripture would be fulfilled.


## John 17:13 (id: 943017013)

13But now I am coming to you, and I am saying these things in the world so that they would have my joy fulfilled in themselves.


## John 17:14 (id: 943017014)

14I have given them your word, and the world has hated them because they are not from the world, just as I am not from the world.


## John 17:15 (id: 943017015)

15I do not ask that you would take them away from the world, but that you would keep them from the evil one.


## John 17:16 (id: 943017016)

16They are not from the world, just as I am not from the world.


## John 17:17 (id: 943017017)

17Sanctify them by the truth; your word is truth.


## John 17:18 (id: 943017018)

18Just as you sent me into the world, I also have sent them into the world.


## John 17:19 (id: 943017019)

19And for their sakes I have sanctified myself, so that they themselves may also be sanctified in truth.


## John 17:20 (id: 943017020)

20But I ask not only on behalf of these, but also on behalf of the ones believing in me through their word,


## John 17:21 (id: 943017021)

21that they would all be one, just as you, Father, {are} in me, and I in you, that they also would be in us so that the world would believe that you have sent me.


## John 17:22 (id: 943017022)

22The glory that you gave to me, I also have given to them so that they would be one, just as we are one:


## John 17:23 (id: 943017023)

23I in them, and you in me so that they may be made complete as one so that the world may know that you sent me and you loved them just as you loved me.


## John 17:24 (id: 943017024)

24Father, the one you have given me, I desire that they also may be with me where I am, in order to see my glory, which you gave me because you loved me before the foundation of the world.


## John 17:25 (id: 943017025)

25Righteous Father, even the world did not know you, but I know you; and these know that you sent me.


## John 17:26 (id: 943017026)

26And I made your name known to them, and I will make {it} known so that the love with which you have loved me may be in them, and I in them.”


## John 18:1 (id: 943018001)

1Having spoken these things, Jesus went out with his disciples across the brook of the Kidron, where there was a garden into which he and his disciples entered.


## John 18:2 (id: 943018002)

2Now Judas, the one betraying him, also knew the place, for Jesus often gathered there with his disciples.


## John 18:3 (id: 943018003)

3So Judas, leading the cohort of soldiers and officers from the chief priests and from the Pharisees, comes there with lanterns and torches and weapons.


## John 18:4 (id: 943018004)

4Then Jesus, knowing all the things happening to him, having gone out, asked them, “Whom do you seek?”


## John 18:5 (id: 943018005)

5They answered him, “Jesus the Nazarene.” He says to them, “I am.” (Now Judas, the one betraying him, was also standing with them.)


## John 18:6 (id: 943018006)

6So when he said to them, “I am,” they went backward and fell to the ground.


## John 18:7 (id: 943018007)

7Then again he asked them, “Whom do you seek?” And they said, “Jesus the Nazarene.”


## John 18:8 (id: 943018008)

8Jesus answered, “I told you that I am. So if you are seeking me, allow these to go away.”


## John 18:9 (id: 943018009)

9({This was} so that would be fulfilled the word that he said: “Of those you have given me, I lost none from among them.”)


## John 18:10 (id: 943018010)

10Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear. Now the name of the servant was Malchus.


## John 18:11 (id: 943018011)

11Then Jesus said to Peter, “Put the sword into the sheath. The cup which the Father has given me, should I certainly not drink it?”


## John 18:12 (id: 943018012)

12Then the cohort of soldiers and the commander and the officers of the Jews seized Jesus and tied him up.


## John 18:13 (id: 943018013)

13And they led him first to Annas, for he was the father\-in\-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.


## John 18:14 (id: 943018014)

14(Now Caiaphas was the one having advised the Jews that it would be better for one man to die on behalf of the people.)


## John 18:15 (id: 943018015)

15Now Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus. Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and he entered with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest.


## John 18:16 (id: 943018016)

16But Peter was standing at the door outside, so the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the female doorkeeper, and he brought Peter in.


## John 18:17 (id: 943018017)

17Then the female servant, the doorkeeper, says to Peter, “Are you not also from the disciples of this man?” He says, “I am not.”


## John 18:18 (id: 943018018)

18(Now the servants and the officers were standing there, having made a charcoal fire, for it was cold, and they were warming themselves. But Peter was also with them, standing there and warming himself.)


## John 18:19 (id: 943018019)

19Then the high priest asked Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching.


## John 18:20 (id: 943018020)

20Jesus answered him, “I have spoken openly to the world. I was always teaching in a synagogue and in the temple where all the Jews come together, and I said nothing in secret.


## John 18:21 (id: 943018021)

21Why do you ask me? Ask the ones having heard what I said to them. Behold, these {people} know what I said.”


## John 18:22 (id: 943018022)

22Now he having said these things, one of the officers standing there gave Jesus a slap, saying, “Do you answer the high priest in this manner?”


## John 18:23 (id: 943018023)

23Jesus answered him, “If I spoke wrongly, testify about the wrong, but if rightly, why do you strike me?”


## John 18:24 (id: 943018024)

24Then Annas sent him, tied up, to Caiaphas the high priest.


## John 18:25 (id: 943018025)

25Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. Then they said to him, “Are you not also from among his disciples?” He denied {it} and said, “I am not.”


## John 18:26 (id: 943018026)

26One from among the servants of the high priest, who was a relative of the one {whose} ear Peter had cut off, says, “Did I not see you in the garden with him?”


## John 18:27 (id: 943018027)

27Peter then denied {it} again, and immediately a rooster crowed.


## John 18:28 (id: 943018028)

28Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the governor’s palace. (Now it was early in the morning, and they did not enter into the governor’s palace so that they would not be defiled, but might eat the Passover.)


## John 18:29 (id: 943018029)

29Therefore, Pilate went out to them and says, “What accusation do you bring against this man?”


## John 18:30 (id: 943018030)

30They answered and said to him, “If this one were not an evildoer, we would not have handed him over to you.”


## John 18:31 (id: 943018031)

31Therefore, Pilate said to them, “Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law.” The Jews said to him, “It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death.”


## John 18:32 (id: 943018032)

32(This was so that the word of Jesus would be fulfilled which he spoke to indicate by what kind of death he was about to die.)


## John 18:33 (id: 943018033)

33Then Pilate entered into the governor’s palace again and summoned Jesus and said to him, “Are you the King of the Jews?”


## John 18:34 (id: 943018034)

34Jesus answered, “Do you speak this from yourself, or did others speak to you about me?”


## John 18:35 (id: 943018035)

35Pilate answered, “I am not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests handed you over to me. What did you do?”


## John 18:36 (id: 943018036)

36Jesus answered, “My kingdom is not from this world. If my kingdom were from this world, my servants would fight so that I would not be handed over to the Jews. But now my kingdom is not from here.”


## John 18:37 (id: 943018037)

37Pilate then said to him, “So then, are you a king?” Jesus answered, “You say that I am a king. For this I have been born, and for this I have come into the world, so that I would bear witness to the truth. Everyone being from the truth hears my voice.”


## John 18:38 (id: 943018038)

38Pilate says to him, “What is truth?” And having said this, he went out again to the Jews and says to them, “I find no guilt in him.


## John 18:39 (id: 943018039)

39But it is your custom that I would release one {person} to you at the Passover. Therefore, do you desire that I would release the King of the Jews to you?”


## John 18:40 (id: 943018040)

40Then they cried out again, saying, “Not this one, but Barabbas.” (Now Barabbas was a robber.)


## John 19:1 (id: 943019001)

1Therefore, Pilate then took Jesus and whipped {him}.


## John 19:2 (id: 943019002)

2And the soldiers twisted together a crown from thorns. They put {it} on his head and put a purple garment on him.


## John 19:3 (id: 943019003)

3And they were coming to him and were saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” and they were giving him slaps.


## John 19:4 (id: 943019004)

4Pilate went out again and says to them, “See, I am bringing him out to you so that you might know that I find no guilt in him.”


## John 19:5 (id: 943019005)

5Then Jesus went out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment. And he says to them, “Behold the man!”


## John 19:6 (id: 943019006)

6Therefore, when the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried out, saying, “Crucify him, crucify him!” Pilate says to them, “Take him yourselves and crucify him, for I find no guilt in him.”


## John 19:7 (id: 943019007)

7The Jews answered him, “We have a law, and according to the law he ought to die, because he made himself to be the Son of God.”


## John 19:8 (id: 943019008)

8Therefore, when Pilate heard this word, he became even more afraid,


## John 19:9 (id: 943019009)

9and he entered into the governor’s palace again and says to Jesus, “Where are you from?” But Jesus gave him no answer.


## John 19:10 (id: 943019010)

10Therefore, Pilate says to him, “Are you not speaking to me? Do you not know that I have authority to release you, and I have authority to crucify you?”


## John 19:11 (id: 943019011)

11Jesus answered him, “You do not have any authority over me, except for what has been given to you from above. Therefore, the one having handed me over to you has a greater sin.”


## John 19:12 (id: 943019012)

12At this, Pilate was seeking to release him, but the Jews cried out, saying, “If you release this one, you are not a friend of Caesar. Everyone making himself a king speaks against Caesar.”


## John 19:13 (id: 943019013)

13Therefore, Pilate, having heard these words, brought Jesus out and sat down in the judgment seat in a place called “The Pavement,” but in Hebrew, “Gabbatha.”


## John 19:14 (id: 943019014)

14(Now it was a day of preparation of the Passover. It was about the sixth hour.) And he says to the Jews, “Behold your king!”


## John 19:15 (id: 943019015)

15But they cried out, “Take {him} away! Take {him} away! Crucify him!” Pilate says to them, “Should I crucify your king?” The chief priests answered, “We have no king except Caesar.”


## John 19:16 (id: 943019016)

16Therefore, he then handed him over to them so that he might be crucified, and they took Jesus {and} led {him} away.


## John 19:17 (id: 943019017)

17And he went out, carrying the cross by himself, to the {place} called “The Place of a Skull,” which in Hebrew is called “Golgotha.”


## John 19:18 (id: 943019018)

18They crucified him there, and with him two others, on this side and on that side, and Jesus in the middle.


## John 19:19 (id: 943019019)

19Now Pilate also wrote a title and put it on the cross. Now on it was written: JESUS THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS.


## John 19:20 (id: 943019020)

20Therefore, many of the Jews read this title, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city. And it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek.


## John 19:21 (id: 943019021)

21Therefore, the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, “Do not write, ‘The King of the Jews,’ but rather, ‘That one said, “I am King of the Jews.”’”


## John 19:22 (id: 943019022)

22Pilate answered, “What I have written I have written.”


## John 19:23 (id: 943019023)

23Then, when the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and divided them into four shares—a share for each soldier—and the tunic. Now the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from the top.


## John 19:24 (id: 943019024)

24Therefore, they said to each other, “We should not tear it, but instead we should cast lots for it, whose it will be.” This happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled which says, “They divided my garments among themselves and cast lots for my clothing.” Therefore, the soldiers did this.


## John 19:25 (id: 943019025)

25Now standing beside the cross of Jesus were his mother and the sister of his mother, Mary the {wife} of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.


## John 19:26 (id: 943019026)

26Then Jesus, having seen his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, says to his mother, “Woman, behold, your son!”


## John 19:27 (id: 943019027)

27Then he says to the disciple, “Behold, your mother!” And from that hour the disciple took her into his own {home}.


## John 19:28 (id: 943019028)

28After this, Jesus, knowing that all things had already been completed, so that the scripture might be completed, says, “I thirst.”


## John 19:29 (id: 943019029)

29A container full of sour wine was placed there, so having put a sponge full of the sour wine on a hyssop, they lifted it up to his mouth.


## John 19:30 (id: 943019030)

30Therefore, when Jesus took the sour wine, he said, “It is finished.” And having bowed his head, he gave up his spirit.


## John 19:31 (id: 943019031)

31Then the Jews, because it was a day of preparation, so that the bodies would not remain on the cross during the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was an especially important day), asked Pilate that their legs would be broken and they would be taken away.


## John 19:32 (id: 943019032)

32Therefore, the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man and of the other one having been crucified with him.


## John 19:33 (id: 943019033)

33But having come to Jesus, as they saw that he had already died, they did not break his legs.


## John 19:34 (id: 943019034)

34However, one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.


## John 19:35 (id: 943019035)

35And the one that had seen this has testified, and his testimony is true. And that one knows that he speaks the truth so that you would also believe.


## John 19:36 (id: 943019036)

36For these things happened in order that the scripture would be fulfilled, “Not one of his bones will be broken.”


## John 19:37 (id: 943019037)

37And again, another scripture says, “They will look at him whom they pierced.”


## John 19:38 (id: 943019038)

38Now after these things, Joseph from Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus (but secretly for fear of the Jews), asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus. And Pilate gave him permission. So he came and took away his body.


## John 19:39 (id: 943019039)

39Now Nicodemus also came—the one having come to him at first at night—bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about 100 litras in weight.


## John 19:40 (id: 943019040)

40So they took the body of Jesus and wrapped it in linen cloths with the spices, just as was the custom of the Jews to prepare for burial.


## John 19:41 (id: 943019041)

41Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden, a new tomb in which no one had yet been buried.


## John 19:42 (id: 943019042)

42Therefore, because of the day of preparation of the Jews and because the tomb was close by, they laid Jesus there.


## John 20:1 (id: 943020001)

1Now early on the first of the week, being still dark, Mary Magdalene comes to the tomb and sees the stone having been rolled away from the tomb.


## John 20:2 (id: 943020002)

2Therefore, she runs and comes to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and she says to them, “They took away the Lord from the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him.”


## John 20:3 (id: 943020003)

3Then Peter and the other disciple went out, and they went to the tomb.


## John 20:4 (id: 943020004)

4Now the two were running together, and the other disciple quickly ran ahead of Peter and arrived at the tomb first.


## John 20:5 (id: 943020005)

5And having stooped down, he sees the linen cloths lying there, but he did not enter.


## John 20:6 (id: 943020006)

6Simon Peter then also comes following him and entered into the tomb. And he sees the linen cloths lying there


## John 20:7 (id: 943020007)

7and the cloth that had been on his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but having been folded up in one place by itself.


## John 20:8 (id: 943020008)

8So then the other disciple, the one having first arrived at the tomb, also went in, and he saw and believed.


## John 20:9 (id: 943020009)

9For they did not yet understand the scripture that it was necessary for him to rise from the dead.


## John 20:10 (id: 943020010)

10Then the disciples went away again to their {own homes}.


## John 20:11 (id: 943020011)

11But Mary was standing outside at the tomb, weeping. Then as she was weeping, she stooped down and looked into the tomb.


## John 20:12 (id: 943020012)

12And she sees two angels in white sitting, one at the head and one at the feet of where the body of Jesus had lain.


## John 20:13 (id: 943020013)

13And those ones say to her, “Woman, why are you weeping?” She says to them, “Because they took away my Lord, and I do not know where they put him.”


## John 20:14 (id: 943020014)

14Having said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, and she did not know that it was Jesus.


## John 20:15 (id: 943020015)

15Jesus says to her, “Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?” She, thinking that he is the gardener, says to him, “Sir, if you carried him away, tell me where you put him, and I will take him away.”


## John 20:16 (id: 943020016)

16Jesus says to her, “Mary.” Having turned, she says to him in Hebrew, “Rabboni” (which means “Teacher”).


## John 20:17 (id: 943020017)

17Jesus says to her, “Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet gone up to the Father; but go to my brothers and say to them, ‘I go up to my Father and your Father, and my God and your God.’”


## John 20:18 (id: 943020018)

18Mary Magdalene comes, telling the disciples, “I have seen the Lord,” and that he said these things to her.


## John 20:19 (id: 943020019)

19Then, being evening on that day, the first of the week, and the doors of where the disciples were having been closed for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in their midst and says to them, “Peace to you.”


## John 20:20 (id: 943020020)

20And having said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples rejoiced, having seen the Lord.


## John 20:21 (id: 943020021)

21Then he said to them again, “Peace to you. Just as the Father has sent me, so I send you.”


## John 20:22 (id: 943020022)

22And having said this, he breathed on {them} and says to them, “Receive the Holy Spirit.


## John 20:23 (id: 943020023)

23Whoever’s sins you forgive, they have been forgiven for them; whoever’s {sins} you retain, they have been retained.”


## John 20:24 (id: 943020024)

24But Thomas, one of the Twelve, the one called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.


## John 20:25 (id: 943020025)

25Then the other disciples said to him, “We have seen the Lord.” But he said to them, “Unless I see in his hands the mark of the nails and put my finger into the mark of the nails and put my hand into his side, I will certainly not believe.”


## John 20:26 (id: 943020026)

26And after eight days his disciples were inside again, and Thomas {was} with them. Jesus comes, the doors having been closed, and stood in their midst, and said, “Peace to you.”


## John 20:27 (id: 943020027)

27Then he says to Thomas, “Place your finger here and see my hands. And reach out your hand and put it into my side. And do not be unbelieving, but believing.”


## John 20:28 (id: 943020028)

28Thomas answered and said to him, “My Lord and my God.”


## John 20:29 (id: 943020029)

29Jesus says to him, “Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed {are} the ones not having seen, and having believed.”


## John 20:30 (id: 943020030)

30Then Jesus also did many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which have not been written in this book,


## John 20:31 (id: 943020031)

31but these things have been written so that you would believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and so that believing, you would have life in his name.


## John 21:1 (id: 943021001)

1After these things, Jesus showed himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberias. Now in this manner he showed himself:


## John 21:2 (id: 943021002)

2they were together—Simon Peter and Thomas called Didymus and Nathaniel from Cana of Galilee and the {sons} of Zebedee and two others from his disciples.


## John 21:3 (id: 943021003)

3Simon Peter says to them, “I am going fishing.” They say to him, “We also are coming with you.” They went out and got into a boat, but they caught nothing during that night.


## John 21:4 (id: 943021004)

4Now, when it was already early morning, Jesus stood on the beach, but the disciples did not know that it is Jesus.


## John 21:5 (id: 943021005)

5Then Jesus says to them, “Children, you do not have any fish to eat, do you?” They answered him, “No.”


## John 21:6 (id: 943021006)

6But he said to them, “Throw the net to the right side of the boat, and you will find some.” Therefore, they threw {the net} and did not have the strength to draw it in, because of the large number of fish.


## John 21:7 (id: 943021007)

7Then that disciple whom Jesus loved says to Peter, “It is the Lord.” Therefore, Simon Peter, having heard that it was the Lord, put on his outer garment (for he was undressed), and threw himself into the sea.


## John 21:8 (id: 943021008)

8But the other disciples came in the boat (for they were not far from the land, but about 200 cubits away), dragging the net of the fish.


## John 21:9 (id: 943021009)

9Then when they got out upon the land, they see a charcoal fire kindled and a fish laid on it and a bread loaf.


## John 21:10 (id: 943021010)

10Jesus says to them, “Bring some of the fish that you just caught.”


## John 21:11 (id: 943021011)

11Therefore, Simon Peter went up and pulled the net to the shore, full of large fish; 153\. But being so many, the net was not torn.


## John 21:12 (id: 943021012)

12Jesus says to them, “Come, eat breakfast.” But none of the disciples dared to ask him, “Who are you?” They knew that it is the Lord.


## John 21:13 (id: 943021013)

13Jesus comes and takes the bread and gives {it} to them, and the fish in the same way.


## John 21:14 (id: 943021014)

14This {was} already the third time that Jesus was revealed to the disciples, having been raised from the dead.


## John 21:15 (id: 943021015)

15Then when they ate breakfast, Jesus says to Simon Peter, “Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?” He says to him, “Yes Lord, you know that I love you.” He says to him, “Feed my lambs.”


## John 21:16 (id: 943021016)

16He says to him again, a second {time}, “Simon, son of John, do you love me?” He says to him, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.” He says to him, “Take care of my sheep.”


## John 21:17 (id: 943021017)

17He says to him the third {time}, “Simon, son of John, do you love me?” Peter was grieved because he said to him the third {time}, “Do you love me?” And he says to him, “Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you.” Jesus says to him, “Feed my sheep.


## John 21:18 (id: 943021018)

18Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were young, you used to gird yourself and walk wherever you wanted, but when you become old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and carry {you} where you do not want.”


## John 21:19 (id: 943021019)

19Now he said this, indicating with what manner of death he will glorify God. And having said this, he says to him, “Follow me.”


## John 21:20 (id: 943021020)

20Having turned around, Peter sees the disciple whom Jesus loved following them, who indeed leaned back against his chest at the dinner and said, “Lord, who is the one betraying you?”


## John 21:21 (id: 943021021)

21Therefore, having seen him, Peter says to Jesus, “But Lord, what about this one?”


## John 21:22 (id: 943021022)

22Jesus says to him, “If I want him to remain until I come, what {is that} to you? You follow me.”


## John 21:23 (id: 943021023)

23So this word spread among the brothers, that that disciple does not die. But Jesus did not say to him that he does not die, but, “If I want him to remain until I come, what {is that} to you?”


## John 21:24 (id: 943021024)

24This is the disciple testifying about these things and the one having written these things, and we know that his testimony is true.


## John 21:25 (id: 943021025)

25Now there are also many other things that Jesus did, which, if each one were written down, I imagine not even the world itself to have enough room for the books being written.
