## Matthew 1:1 (id: 940001001)

1The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, son of David, son of Abraham:


## Matthew 1:2 (id: 940001002)

2Abraham fathered Isaac, and Isaac fathered Jacob, and Jacob fathered Judah and his brothers,

3and Judah fathered Perez and Zerah by Tamar, and Perez fathered Hezrom, and Hezrom fathered Aram,


## Matthew 1:4 (id: 940001004)

4and Aram fathered Amminadab, and Amminadab fathered Nahshon, and Nahshon fathered Salmon,


## Matthew 1:5 (id: 940001005)

5and Salmon fathered Boaz by Rahab, and Boaz fathered Obed by Ruth, and Obed fathered Jesse,


## Matthew 1:6 (id: 940001006)

6and Jesse fathered David the king, and David fathered Solomon by the {wife} of Uriah,


## Matthew 1:7 (id: 940001007)

7and Solomon fathered Rehoboam, and Rehoboam fathered Abijah, and Abijah fathered Asaph,


## Matthew 1:8 (id: 940001008)

8and Asaph fathered Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat fathered Joram, and Joram fathered Ozias,


## Matthew 1:9 (id: 940001009)

9and Ozias fathered Jotham, and Jotham fathered Ahaz, and Ahaz fathered Hezekiah,


## Matthew 1:10 (id: 940001010)

10and Hezekiah fathered Manasseh, and Manasseh fathered Amos, and Amos fathered Josiah,


## Matthew 1:11 (id: 940001011)

11and Josiah fathered Jechoniah and his brothers at the Babylonian deportation,


## Matthew 1:12 (id: 940001012)

12and after the Babylonian deportation, Jechoniah fathered Salathiel, and Salathiel fathered Zerubbabel,


## Matthew 1:13 (id: 940001013)

13and Zerubbabel fathered Abiud, and Abiud fathered Eliakim, and Eliakim fathered Azor,


## Matthew 1:14 (id: 940001014)

14and Azor fathered Zadok, and Zadok fathered Achim, and Achim fathered Eliud,


## Matthew 1:15 (id: 940001015)

15and Eliud fathered Eleazar, and Eleazar fathered Matthan, and Matthan fathered Jacob,


## Matthew 1:16 (id: 940001016)

16and Jacob fathered Joseph the husband of Mary, by whom Jesus was born, the one called Christ.


## Matthew 1:17 (id: 940001017)

17Therefore, all the generations from Abraham until David {were} 14 generations, and from David until the Babylonian deportation {were} 14 generations, and from the Babylonian deportation until the Christ {were} 14 generations.


## Matthew 1:18 (id: 940001018)

18Now the birth of Jesus Christ was thus: His mother, Mary, having been engaged to marry Joseph, before they came together, was found having in the womb from the Holy Spirit.


## Matthew 1:19 (id: 940001019)

19Now Joseph her husband, being righteous, and not wanting to publicly disgrace her, intended to divorce her secretly.


## Matthew 1:20 (id: 940001020)

20But he having reflected on these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him by way of a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, you should not fear to take Mary as your wife, because the one having been conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.


## Matthew 1:21 (id: 940001021)

21And she will bear a son, and you will call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.”


## Matthew 1:22 (id: 940001022)

22Now all this happened so that might be fulfilled {what} was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,


## Matthew 1:23 (id: 940001023)

23“Behold, the virgin will have in her womb and bear a son, and they will call his name Immanuel”—which is translated, “God with us.”


## Matthew 1:24 (id: 940001024)

24And Joseph, having been awakened from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took her {as} his wife.


## Matthew 1:25 (id: 940001025)

25And he did not know her until she bore a son. And he called his name Jesus.


## Matthew 2:1 (id: 940002001)

1Now, Jesus having been born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, learned men from the east arrived in Jerusalem,


## Matthew 2:2 (id: 940002002)

2saying, “Where is the one having been born King of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east and came to worship him.”


## Matthew 2:3 (id: 940002003)

3But having heard this, Herod the king became troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.


## Matthew 2:4 (id: 940002004)

4And having brought together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired from them, “Where is the Christ being born?”


## Matthew 2:5 (id: 940002005)

5And they said to him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it has been written through the prophet,


## Matthew 2:6 (id: 940002006)

6‘And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah, are by no means least among the leaders of Judah, for from you will come out a ruling one who will shepherd my people Israel.’”


## Matthew 2:7 (id: 940002007)

7Then Herod, having secretly called the learned men, inquired from them the time of the appearing of the star.


## Matthew 2:8 (id: 940002008)

8And having sent them to Bethlehem, he said, “Having gone, search carefully for the young child, and after you have found him, report to me so that I also, having come, might worship him.”


## Matthew 2:9 (id: 940002009)

9And they, having heard the king, went, and behold, the star that they saw in the east was going before them until, having come, it stood over where the young child was.


## Matthew 2:10 (id: 940002010)

10And having seen the star, they rejoiced with very great joy.


## Matthew 2:11 (id: 940002011)

11And having gone into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother. And having fallen down, they worshiped him, and having opened their treasures, they offered him gifts: gold and frankincense and myrrh.


## Matthew 2:12 (id: 940002012)

12And having been warned through a dream not to return to Herod, they departed to their country by another way.


## Matthew 2:13 (id: 940002013)

13Now they having departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appears to Joseph by means of a dream, saying, “Having gotten up, take the young child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you, for Herod is going to seek the young child to kill him.”


## Matthew 2:14 (id: 940002014)

14And having gotten up, he took the young child and his mother at night and departed for Egypt,


## Matthew 2:15 (id: 940002015)

15and he was there until the death of Herod, in order that might be fulfilled {what} was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, “Out of Egypt I called my son.”


## Matthew 2:16 (id: 940002016)

16Then Herod, having seen that he had been mocked by the learned men, was very angry, and having sent forth, he killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all its region, from two years and under, according to the time that he had determined exactly from the learned men.


## Matthew 2:17 (id: 940002017)

17Then it was fulfilled {what} was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying,


## Matthew 2:18 (id: 940002018)

18“A voice was heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and not willing to be comforted, because they are no more.”


## Matthew 2:19 (id: 940002019)

19Now Herod having died, behold, an angel of the Lord appears by means of a dream to Joseph in Egypt,


## Matthew 2:20 (id: 940002020)

20saying, “Having gotten up, take the young child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for the ones seeking the life of the child have died.”


## Matthew 2:21 (id: 940002021)

21And he, having gotten up, took the young child and his mother, and entered into the land of Israel.


## Matthew 2:22 (id: 940002022)

22But having heard that Archelaus is reigning over Judea in the place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. But having been warned by means of a dream, he withdrew to the region of Galilee,


## Matthew 2:23 (id: 940002023)

23and having gone, he lived in a city being called Nazareth, so that it might be fulfilled {what} was spoken through the prophets, that he will be called a Nazarene.


## Matthew 3:1 (id: 940003001)

1Now in those days, John the Baptist comes, preaching in the wilderness of Judea,


## Matthew 3:2 (id: 940003002)

2saying, “Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens is near.”


## Matthew 3:3 (id: 940003003)

3For this is the one spoken of through Isaiah the prophet, saying, “A voice of one calling out in the wilderness, ‘Make ready the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.’”


## Matthew 3:4 (id: 940003004)

4Now this John had his clothing from the hair of a camel and a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey.


## Matthew 3:5 (id: 940003005)

5Then were going out to him Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the {region} around the Jordan,


## Matthew 3:6 (id: 940003006)

6and being baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.


## Matthew 3:7 (id: 940003007)

7Now having seen many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for his baptism, he said to them, “Offspring of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?


## Matthew 3:8 (id: 940003008)

8Therefore, produce fruit worthy of repentance.


## Matthew 3:9 (id: 940003009)

9And you should not think to say in yourselves, ‘We have Abraham {as} father.’ For I say to you that God is able to raise up children for Abraham from these stones.


## Matthew 3:10 (id: 940003010)

10But already the ax is set against the root of the trees. So, every tree not producing good fruit is chopped down and thrown into a fire.


## Matthew 3:11 (id: 940003011)

11I indeed baptize you with water for repentance. But the one coming after me is more powerful than I, of whom I am not worthy to carry away his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire,


## Matthew 3:12 (id: 940003012)

12whose winnowing fork {is} in his hand, and he will thoroughly clear off his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the storehouse. But he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”


## Matthew 3:13 (id: 940003013)

13Then Jesus comes from Galilee to the Jordan, to John, to be baptized by him.


## Matthew 3:14 (id: 940003014)

14But John was hindering him, saying, “I have need to be baptized by you, and yet you come to me?”


## Matthew 3:15 (id: 940003015)

15But answering, Jesus said to him, “Permit {it} now, for in this way it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.” Then he permits him.


## Matthew 3:16 (id: 940003016)

16Now having been baptized, Jesus immediately came up from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God coming down like a dove, resting upon him,


## Matthew 3:17 (id: 940003017)

17and behold, a voice from the heavens, saying, “This is my beloved Son with whom I am well pleased.”


## Matthew 4:1 (id: 940004001)

1Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.


## Matthew 4:2 (id: 940004002)

2And having fasted 40 days and 40 nights, afterward he was hungry.


## Matthew 4:3 (id: 940004003)

3And having approached, the one tempting said to him, “If you are the Son of God, speak so that these stones might become loaves.”


## Matthew 4:4 (id: 940004004)

4But he, answering, said, “It is written, ‘Man will not live on bread alone, but by every word coming through the mouth of God.’”


## Matthew 4:5 (id: 940004005)

5Then the devil takes him into the holy city, and he set him on the highest point of the temple,


## Matthew 4:6 (id: 940004006)

6and says to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written, ‘He will command his angels concerning you,’ and, ‘They will lift you up in their hands, lest you strike your foot against a stone.’”


## Matthew 4:7 (id: 940004007)

7Jesus said to him, “Again it is written, ‘You will not test the Lord your God.’”


## Matthew 4:8 (id: 940004008)

8Again, the devil takes him to a very high mountain and shows him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.


## Matthew 4:9 (id: 940004009)

9And he said to him, “All these things I will give you, if having fallen down, you would worship me.”


## Matthew 4:10 (id: 940004010)

10Then Jesus says to him, “Go away, Satan! For it is written, ‘You will worship the Lord your God, and you will serve only him.’”


## Matthew 4:11 (id: 940004011)

11Then the devil leaves him, and behold, angels came and began to minister to him.


## Matthew 4:12 (id: 940004012)

12Now having heard that John had been arrested, he withdrew into Galilee.


## Matthew 4:13 (id: 940004013)

13And having left Nazareth, having come, he lived in Capernaum by the sea, in the territories of Zebulun and Naphtali,


## Matthew 4:14 (id: 940004014)

14so that it might be fulfilled what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,


## Matthew 4:15 (id: 940004015)

15“The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, { the} way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles—


## Matthew 4:16 (id: 940004016)

16the people sitting in darkness have seen a great light, and to the ones sitting in the region and shadow of death, upon them has a light arisen.”


## Matthew 4:17 (id: 940004017)

17From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, “Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has come near.”


## Matthew 4:18 (id: 940004018)

18Now walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.


## Matthew 4:19 (id: 940004019)

19And he says to them, “Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men.”


## Matthew 4:20 (id: 940004020)

20And immediately, they, having left the nets, followed him.


## Matthew 4:21 (id: 940004021)

21And having gone on from there, he saw two other brothers, James the {son} of Zebedee, and John his brother in the boat with Zebedee their father mending their nets, and he called them,


## Matthew 4:22 (id: 940004022)

22and immediately they, having left the boat and their father, followed him.


## Matthew 4:23 (id: 940004023)

23And he was going around in all of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.


## Matthew 4:24 (id: 940004024)

24And the news of him went out into all Syria, and they brought to him all the ones having sickness, being afflicted by various diseases and pains, and being possessed by demons, and the epileptic and the paralytic, and he healed them.


## Matthew 4:25 (id: 940004025)

25And large crowds followed him from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judea and beyond the Jordan.


## Matthew 5:1 (id: 940005001)

1Now having seen the crowds, he went up on the mountain, and he having sat down, his disciples came to him.


## Matthew 5:2 (id: 940005002)

2And having opened his mouth, he taught them, saying,


## Matthew 5:3 (id: 940005003)

3“Blessed {are} the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.


## Matthew 5:4 (id: 940005004)

4Blessed {are} the ones mourning, for they will be comforted.


## Matthew 5:5 (id: 940005005)

5Blessed {are} the meek, for they will inherit the earth.


## Matthew 5:6 (id: 940005006)

6Blessed {are} the ones hungering and thirsting for righteousness, for they will be fed.


## Matthew 5:7 (id: 940005007)

7Blessed {are} the merciful, for they will obtain mercy.


## Matthew 5:8 (id: 940005008)

8Blessed {are} the pure in heart, for they will see God.


## Matthew 5:9 (id: 940005009)

9Blessed {are} the peacemakers, for they will be called sons of God.


## Matthew 5:10 (id: 940005010)

10Blessed {are} the ones persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.


## Matthew 5:11 (id: 940005011)

11Blessed are you when they insult you and persecute {you} and say every evil thing against you, lying, because of me.


## Matthew 5:12 (id: 940005012)

12Rejoice and be very glad, for your reward {is} great in the heavens, for in this way they persecuted the prophets before you.


## Matthew 5:13 (id: 940005013)

13You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt is made tasteless, with what might it be made salty again? It is good for nothing any longer, except having been thrown out, to be trampled by men.


## Matthew 5:14 (id: 940005014)

14You are the light of the world. A city being set on top of a mountain is not able to be hidden.


## Matthew 5:15 (id: 940005015)

15Neither do they light a lamp and put it under a basket, but rather on the lampstand, and it shines for all the ones in the house.


## Matthew 5:16 (id: 940005016)

16Let your light shine before men in such a way so that they might see your good deeds and might glorify your Father in the heavens.


## Matthew 5:17 (id: 940005017)

17Do not think that I came to destroy the law or the prophets. I came not to destroy but to fulfill.


## Matthew 5:18 (id: 940005018)

18For truly I say to you, until the heaven and the earth passes away, one jot or one tittle will certainly not pass away from the law until all things are accomplished.


## Matthew 5:19 (id: 940005019)

19Therefore, whoever annuls one of the least of these commandments and teaches men to do so will be called least in the kingdom of the heavens. But whoever does and teaches {them}, that one will be called great in the kingdom of the heavens.


## Matthew 5:20 (id: 940005020)

20For I say to you that unless your righteousness abounds more than that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will certainly not enter into the kingdom of the heavens.


## Matthew 5:21 (id: 940005021)

21You have heard that it was said to the ancient ones, ‘Do not kill,’ and, ‘Whoever kills will be subject to the judgment.’


## Matthew 5:22 (id: 940005022)

22But I say to you that everyone being angry with his brother will be subject to the judgment. And whoever says to his brother, ‘Raka!’ will be subject to the council. And whoever says, ‘You fool!’ will be subject to the Gehenna of fire.


## Matthew 5:23 (id: 940005023)

23Therefore, if you offer your gift at the altar and there you remember that your brother has something against you,


## Matthew 5:24 (id: 940005024)

24leave your gift there in front of the altar and go; first be reconciled with your brother, and then, having come, offer your gift.


## Matthew 5:25 (id: 940005025)

25Be in agreement with your accuser quickly while you are with him on the way, lest your accuser might hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and you will be thrown into prison.


## Matthew 5:26 (id: 940005026)

26Truly I say to you, you will certainly not come out from there until you have paid the last quadrans.


## Matthew 5:27 (id: 940005027)

27You have heard that it was said, ‘Do not commit adultery.’


## Matthew 5:28 (id: 940005028)

28But I say to you that everyone looking at a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.


## Matthew 5:29 (id: 940005029)

29But if your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw {it} away from you. For it is better for you that one of your members would perish and your whole body would not be thrown into Gehenna.


## Matthew 5:30 (id: 940005030)

30And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw {it} away from you. For it is better for you that one of your members would perish and your whole body would not go into Gehenna.


## Matthew 5:31 (id: 940005031)

31Now it has been said, ‘Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.’


## Matthew 5:32 (id: 940005032)

32But I say to you that everyone divorcing his wife, except for a report of sexual immorality, causes her to commit adultery. And whoever marries {the one who} has been divorced commits adultery.


## Matthew 5:33 (id: 940005033)

33Again, you have heard that it was said to the ancient ones, ‘Do not break an oath, but carry out your oaths to the Lord.’


## Matthew 5:34 (id: 940005034)

34But I tell you not to swear at all, neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God;


## Matthew 5:35 (id: 940005035)

35nor by the earth, for it is a footstool for his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.


## Matthew 5:36 (id: 940005036)

36Neither should you swear by your head, for you are not able to make one hair white or black.


## Matthew 5:37 (id: 940005037)

37But let your word be ‘Yes, yes,’ {or} ‘No, no.’ But anything greater than this is from the evil one.


## Matthew 5:38 (id: 940005038)

38You have heard that it was said, ‘An eye in exchange for an eye, and a tooth in exchange for a tooth.’


## Matthew 5:39 (id: 940005039)

39But I tell you not to resist the evil one. Instead, whoever strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.


## Matthew 5:40 (id: 940005040)

40And to the one wanting to have judgment passed upon you and to take away your tunic, let him also have your cloak.


## Matthew 5:41 (id: 940005041)

41And whoever will press you into service for one mile, go with him two.


## Matthew 5:42 (id: 940005042)

42Give to the one asking you, and do not turn away from the one wanting to borrow from you.


## Matthew 5:43 (id: 940005043)

43You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’


## Matthew 5:44 (id: 940005044)

44But I say to you, love your enemies and pray on behalf of the ones persecuting you


## Matthew 5:45 (id: 940005045)

45so that you might be sons of your Father in the heavens. For he makes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and he sends rain on the just and the unjust.


## Matthew 5:46 (id: 940005046)

46For if you love the ones loving you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same thing?


## Matthew 5:47 (id: 940005047)

47And if you greet only your brothers, what do you do more? Do not even the Gentiles do the same thing?


## Matthew 5:48 (id: 940005048)

48Therefore, you shall be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.


## Matthew 6:1 (id: 940006001)

1Now take heed not to do your righteousness before men to be seen by them, otherwise, you do not have a reward with your Father in the heavens.


## Matthew 6:2 (id: 940006002)

2So when you give alms, do not sound a trumpet before yourself even as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets so that they may be glorified by men. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full.


## Matthew 6:3 (id: 940006003)

3But you, giving alms, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing


## Matthew 6:4 (id: 940006004)

4so that your alms may be in secret, and your Father seeing in secret will reward you.


## Matthew 6:5 (id: 940006005)

5And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray, having stood in the synagogues and on the corners of the street, so that they may be seen by men. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full.


## Matthew 6:6 (id: 940006006)

6But you, when you pray, enter into your inner chamber, and having shut your door, pray to your Father in secret, and your Father seeing in secret will reward you.


## Matthew 6:7 (id: 940006007)

7Now praying, do not make useless repetitions even as the Gentiles, for they think that because of their many words they will be heard.


## Matthew 6:8 (id: 940006008)

8Therefore, you should not be like them, for your Father knows what need you have before you ask him.


## Matthew 6:9 (id: 940006009)

9Therefore, you must pray like this: ‘Our Father in the heavens, let your name be made holy.


## Matthew 6:10 (id: 940006010)

10Let your kingdom come, let your will be done as in heaven also on earth.


## Matthew 6:11 (id: 940006011)

11Give us today our daily bread;


## Matthew 6:12 (id: 940006012)

12and forgive us our debts, as we also forgave our debtors;


## Matthew 6:13 (id: 940006013)

13and do not bring us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.’


## Matthew 6:14 (id: 940006014)

14For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.


## Matthew 6:15 (id: 940006015)

15But if you do not forgive the men, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.


## Matthew 6:16 (id: 940006016)

16Now when you fast, do not be mournful as the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces so that they may be seen as fasting by men. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full.


## Matthew 6:17 (id: 940006017)

17But you, {when} fasting, anoint your head and wash your face


## Matthew 6:18 (id: 940006018)

18so that you would not be seen as fasting by men, but only by your Father in secret; and your Father, seeing in secret, will reward you.


## Matthew 6:19 (id: 940006019)

19Do not store up for yourselves treasures on the earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.


## Matthew 6:20 (id: 940006020)

20Instead, store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in nor steal.


## Matthew 6:21 (id: 940006021)

21For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.


## Matthew 6:22 (id: 940006022)

22The lamp of the body is the eye. Therefore, if your eye is healthy, your whole body will be illuminated.


## Matthew 6:23 (id: 940006023)

23But if your eye is evil, your whole body will be dark. Therefore, if the light in you is darkness, how great {is} the darkness!


## Matthew 6:24 (id: 940006024)

24No one is able to serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and will love the other, or else he will be devoted to one and will despise the other. You are not able to serve God and wealth.


## Matthew 6:25 (id: 940006025)

25Because of this I say to you, do not worry about your life, what you might eat or what you might drink, nor about your body, what you might wear. Is not life more than food, and the body, {than} clothing?


## Matthew 6:26 (id: 940006026)

26Look at the birds of the sky, that they do not sow nor reap nor gather into barns, but your heavenly Father feeds them. {Are} you not more valuable than they?


## Matthew 6:27 (id: 940006027)

27But which of you, being anxious, is able to add one cubit to his lifespan?


## Matthew 6:28 (id: 940006028)

28And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field—how they grow. They do not labor, neither do they spin.


## Matthew 6:29 (id: 940006029)

29But I say to you that not even Solomon in all his glory clothed himself like one of these.


## Matthew 6:30 (id: 940006030)

30But if God thus clothes the grass of the field, existing today and tomorrow being thrown into an oven, {will he} not much more you, ones of little faith?


## Matthew 6:31 (id: 940006031)

31Therefore, you should not be anxious, saying, ‘What might we eat?’ or, ‘What might we drink?’ or, ‘What might we wear?’


## Matthew 6:32 (id: 940006032)

32For the Gentiles seek all these things; for your heavenly Father knows that you need all of these things.


## Matthew 6:33 (id: 940006033)

33But seek first the kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.


## Matthew 6:34 (id: 940006034)

34Therefore, you should not be anxious for tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day {is} its evil.


## Matthew 7:1 (id: 940007001)

1Do not judge, so that you will not be judged.


## Matthew 7:2 (id: 940007002)

2For with the judgment by which you judge, you will be judged, and with the measure by which you measure, it will be measured to you.


## Matthew 7:3 (id: 940007003)

3Now why do you look at the speck of wood that {is} in the eye of your brother, but you do not notice the log in your eye?


## Matthew 7:4 (id: 940007004)

4Or how will you say to your brother, ‘Let me take out the speck of wood from your eye,’ while behold, the log {is} in your eye?


## Matthew 7:5 (id: 940007005)

5You hypocrite! First take out the log from your eye, and then you will see clearly to take out the speck of wood from the eye of your brother.


## Matthew 7:6 (id: 940007006)

6You should neither give the holy to the dogs nor should you throw your pearls in front of the pigs. Otherwise, they will trample them under their feet, and having turned, they will tear you to pieces.


## Matthew 7:7 (id: 940007007)

7Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.


## Matthew 7:8 (id: 940007008)

8For everyone asking receives; and the one seeking finds; and to the one knocking, it will be opened.


## Matthew 7:9 (id: 940007009)

9Or what man is there from among you, of whom his son will ask for bread—he will not give him a stone, will he?


## Matthew 7:10 (id: 940007010)

10Or he will also ask for a fish—he will not give him a snake, will he?


## Matthew 7:11 (id: 940007011)

11Therefore, if you, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in the heavens give good things to the ones asking him?


## Matthew 7:12 (id: 940007012)

12Therefore, all things in as much as you desire that men do to you, in this manner also, you do to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets.


## Matthew 7:13 (id: 940007013)

13Enter through the narrow gate. For wide {is} the gate and broad {is} the road that is leading to destruction, and there are many entering through it.


## Matthew 7:14 (id: 940007014)

14For the gate {is} narrow and the road has been made narrow that is leading to life, and there are few finding it.


## Matthew 7:15 (id: 940007015)

15Beware of the false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.


## Matthew 7:16 (id: 940007016)

16By their fruits you will recognize them. They do not gather grapes from a thornbush or figs from thistles, do they?


## Matthew 7:17 (id: 940007017)

17In the same way, every good tree produces good fruits, but the rotten tree produces bad fruits.


## Matthew 7:18 (id: 940007018)

18A good tree is not able to produce bad fruits, nor a rotten tree to produce good fruits.


## Matthew 7:19 (id: 940007019)

19Every tree not producing good fruit is cut down and thrown into a fire.


## Matthew 7:20 (id: 940007020)

20So then, by their fruits you will recognize them.


## Matthew 7:21 (id: 940007021)

21Not everyone saying to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but the one doing the will of my Father in the heavens.


## Matthew 7:22 (id: 940007022)

22Many will say to me in that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name cast out demons, and in your name do many mighty deeds?’


## Matthew 7:23 (id: 940007023)

23And then I will publicly declare to them, ‘I never knew you! Go away from me, the ones practicing lawlessness!’


## Matthew 7:24 (id: 940007024)

24Therefore, everyone who hears these words of mine and does them will be compared to a wise man who built his house upon the rock.


## Matthew 7:25 (id: 940007025)

25And the rain came down, and the floods came, and the winds blew and struck against that house, but it did not fall down, for it had been founded on the rock.


## Matthew 7:26 (id: 940007026)

26But everyone hearing these words of mine and not doing them will be compared to a foolish man who built his house upon the sand.


## Matthew 7:27 (id: 940007027)

27And the rain came down, and the floods came, and the winds blew and struck against that house, and it fell, and its destruction was great.”


## Matthew 7:28 (id: 940007028)

28And it happened that when Jesus finished speaking these words, the crowds were astonished at his teaching,


## Matthew 7:29 (id: 940007029)

29for he was teaching them as having authority, and not as their scribes.


## Matthew 8:1 (id: 940008001)

1Now {when} he had come down from the mountain, large crowds followed him.


## Matthew 8:2 (id: 940008002)

2And behold, a leper, having approached, bowed before him, saying, “Lord, if you are willing, you are able to make me clean.”


## Matthew 8:3 (id: 940008003)

3And having reached out his hand, he touched him, saying, “I am willing. Be clean.” And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.


## Matthew 8:4 (id: 940008004)

4And Jesus says to him, “See that you tell no one, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.”


## Matthew 8:5 (id: 940008005)

5Now {when} he had entered into Capernaum, a centurion came to him, begging him


## Matthew 8:6 (id: 940008006)

6and saying, “Lord, my servant has been lying in the house paralyzed, being tormented terribly.”


## Matthew 8:7 (id: 940008007)

7And he says to him, “I, {when} I have come, will heal him.”


## Matthew 8:8 (id: 940008008)

8And answering, the centurion said, “Lord, I am not worthy that you might enter under my roof, but only speak a word, and my servant will be healed.


## Matthew 8:9 (id: 940008009)

9For I also am a man placed under authority, having soldiers under me, and I say to this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and to another one, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does {it}.”


## Matthew 8:10 (id: 940008010)

10But having heard this, Jesus was amazed and said to the ones following him, “Truly I say to you, I have found such great faith from no one in Israel.


## Matthew 8:11 (id: 940008011)

11But I tell you that many will come from east and west, and they will recline to eat with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of the heavens.


## Matthew 8:12 (id: 940008012)

12But the sons of the kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and grinding of the teeth.”


## Matthew 8:13 (id: 940008013)

13And Jesus said to the centurion, “Go! As you believed, let it be done for you.” And the servant was healed at that hour.


## Matthew 8:14 (id: 940008014)

14And {when} Jesus had come into the house of Peter, he saw his mother\-in\-law having been laid down and being sick with a fever.


## Matthew 8:15 (id: 940008015)

15And he touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she got up and began to serve him.


## Matthew 8:16 (id: 940008016)

16Now evening having come, they brought to him many being possessed by demons, and he cast out the spirits with a word and healed all the ones having sickness,


## Matthew 8:17 (id: 940008017)

17so that might be fulfilled that which had been spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying, “He himself took our sicknesses and bore our diseases.”


## Matthew 8:18 (id: 940008018)

18Now Jesus, having seen a crowd around him, commanded to depart to the other side.


## Matthew 8:19 (id: 940008019)

19And having approached, a scribe said to him, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.”


## Matthew 8:20 (id: 940008020)

20And Jesus says to him, “The foxes have dens, and the birds of the sky, nests, but the Son of Man does not have {a place} where he might lay his head.”


## Matthew 8:21 (id: 940008021)

21Now another of the disciples said to him, “Lord, permit me first to go away and to bury my father.”


## Matthew 8:22 (id: 940008022)

22But Jesus says to him, “Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead.”


## Matthew 8:23 (id: 940008023)

23And {when} he had gotten into a boat, his disciples followed him.


## Matthew 8:24 (id: 940008024)

24And behold, a great storm happened on the sea, so that the boat was covered by the waves. But he was sleeping.


## Matthew 8:25 (id: 940008025)

25And having approached, they woke him, saying, “Lord, save us; we are perishing!”


## Matthew 8:26 (id: 940008026)

26And he says to them, “Why are you cowardly, you of little faith?” Then, having gotten up, he rebuked the winds and the sea, and a great calm happened.


## Matthew 8:27 (id: 940008027)

27But the men marveled, saying, “What sort of {man} is he, that even the winds and the sea obey him?”


## Matthew 8:28 (id: 940008028)

28And {when} he had come to the other side, to the region of the Gadarenes, two men met him, being possessed by demons, coming out of the tombs, very violent, so that no one was strong enough to pass through that road.


## Matthew 8:29 (id: 940008029)

29And behold, they cried out, saying, “What to us and to you, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the set time?”


## Matthew 8:30 (id: 940008030)

30Now a herd of many pigs was feeding at a distance from them.


## Matthew 8:31 (id: 940008031)

31But the demons were begging him, saying, “If you cast us out, send us away into the herd of the pigs.”


## Matthew 8:32 (id: 940008032)

32And he said to them, “Go!” And they, having come out, went away into the pigs; and behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep slope into the sea, and they died in the water.


## Matthew 8:33 (id: 940008033)

33Now the ones feeding them ran away and, having gone away to the city, they reported everything, and the {things concerning} the ones possessed by demons.


## Matthew 8:34 (id: 940008034)

34And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus. And having seen him, they begged him that he would depart from their region.


## Matthew 9:1 (id: 940009001)

1And having gotten into a boat, he crossed over and came to his own city.


## Matthew 9:2 (id: 940009002)

2And behold, they were bringing to him a paralytic lying on a mat. And Jesus, having seen their faith, said to the paralytic, “Child, have courage. Your sins are forgiven.”


## Matthew 9:3 (id: 940009003)

3And behold, some of the scribes said among themselves, “This one blasphemes.”


## Matthew 9:4 (id: 940009004)

4And Jesus, having seen their thoughts, said, “For what reason do you think evil in your hearts?


## Matthew 9:5 (id: 940009005)

5For which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins have been forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk’?


## Matthew 9:6 (id: 940009006)

6But in order that you might know that the Son of Man has authority on the earth to forgive sins,”—he then says to the paralytic—“Getting up, pick up your mat, and go to your house.”


## Matthew 9:7 (id: 940009007)

7And having gotten up, he went away to his house.


## Matthew 9:8 (id: 940009008)

8Now {when} the crowds had seen this, they were afraid and glorified God, having given such authority to men.


## Matthew 9:9 (id: 940009009)

9And Jesus, passing on from there, saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector’s office, and he says to him, “Follow me.” And having gotten up, he followed him.


## Matthew 9:10 (id: 940009010)

10And it happened that he was reclining to eat in the house, and behold, many tax collectors and sinners, having come, were dining with Jesus and his disciples.


## Matthew 9:11 (id: 940009011)

11And the Pharisees, having seen this, were saying to his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?”


## Matthew 9:12 (id: 940009012)

12But he, having heard this, said, “The ones being healthy do not have need of a physician, but the ones having sickness.


## Matthew 9:13 (id: 940009013)

13But having gone, learn what this is: ‘I desire mercy and not sacrifice.’ For I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”


## Matthew 9:14 (id: 940009014)

14Then the disciples of John come to him, saying, “For what reason do we and the Pharisees often fast, but your disciples do not fast?”


## Matthew 9:15 (id: 940009015)

15And Jesus said to them, “The sons of the bridal chamber are not able to mourn while the bridegroom is still with them, are they? But days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.


## Matthew 9:16 (id: 940009016)

16Now no one puts a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for its patch tears away from the garment, and a worse tear happens.


## Matthew 9:17 (id: 940009017)

17Neither do they put new wine into old wineskins. But if not, the skins are burst, and the wine is spilled, and the wineskins are destroyed. But they put new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved.”


## Matthew 9:18 (id: 940009018)

18{While} he was saying these things to them, behold, a certain official, having approached, bowed down to him, saying, “My daughter has just now died, but, having come, lay your hand on her, and she will live.”


## Matthew 9:19 (id: 940009019)

19And having gotten up, Jesus and his disciples followed him.


## Matthew 9:20 (id: 940009020)

20And behold, a woman suffering from a discharge of blood for 12 years, having approached from behind, touched the edge of his cloak,


## Matthew 9:21 (id: 940009021)

21for she was saying in herself, “If only I touch his cloak, I will be saved.”


## Matthew 9:22 (id: 940009022)

22But Jesus, having turned and having seen her, said, “Daughter, take courage; your faith has saved you.” And the woman was saved from that hour.


## Matthew 9:23 (id: 940009023)

23And Jesus, having come to the house of the official and having seen the flute players and the crowd being disturbed,


## Matthew 9:24 (id: 940009024)

24said, “Go away, for the girl has not died, but sleeps.” And they were laughing at him.


## Matthew 9:25 (id: 940009025)

25But when the crowd had been put outside, having entered, he took her hand, and the girl was raised up.


## Matthew 9:26 (id: 940009026)

26And this report went out into all that region.


## Matthew 9:27 (id: 940009027)

27And {as} Jesus was departing from there, two blind men followed him, crying out and saying, “Have mercy on us, Son of David!”


## Matthew 9:28 (id: 940009028)

28Now {when} he had come into the house, the blind men came to him and Jesus says to them, “Do you believe that I am able to do this?” They say to him, “Yes, Lord.”


## Matthew 9:29 (id: 940009029)

29Then he touched their eyes, saying, “Let it be done to you according to your faith.”


## Matthew 9:30 (id: 940009030)

30And their eyes were opened, and Jesus warned them, saying, “See that you let no one know {about this}.”


## Matthew 9:31 (id: 940009031)

31But they, having gone out, reported it in all that region.


## Matthew 9:32 (id: 940009032)

32Now {as} they were going away, behold, they brought to him a mute, demon\-possessed man.


## Matthew 9:33 (id: 940009033)

33And the demon having been cast out, the mute {man} spoke, and the crowds marveled, saying, “Such as this has never been seen in Israel!”


## Matthew 9:34 (id: 940009034)

34But the Pharisees were saying, “By the ruler of the demons he casts out the demons.”


## Matthew 9:35 (id: 940009035)

35And Jesus was going around all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness.


## Matthew 9:36 (id: 940009036)

36Now having seen the crowds, he felt compassion for them, because they were troubled and discouraged, like sheep not having a shepherd.


## Matthew 9:37 (id: 940009037)

37Then he says to his disciples, “Indeed, the harvest {is} plentiful, but the laborers {are} few.


## Matthew 9:38 (id: 940009038)

38Therefore, earnestly ask the Lord of the harvest, so that he might send out laborers into his harvest.”


## Matthew 10:1 (id: 940010001)

1And having summoned his 12 disciples, he gave them authority over unclean spirits, so as to cast them out and to heal every disease and every sickness.


## Matthew 10:2 (id: 940010002)

2Now the names of the 12 apostles are these: first, Simon (called Peter), and Andrew his brother; and James the {son} of Zebedee, and John his brother;


## Matthew 10:3 (id: 940010003)

3Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the {son} of Alphaeus and Thaddaeus;


## Matthew 10:4 (id: 940010004)

4Simon the Cananaios, and Judas Iscariot, the {one} having also handed him over.


## Matthew 10:5 (id: 940010005)

5These 12 Jesus sent out, having instructed them, saying, “Do not go on the way {to the} Gentiles, and do not enter into a city of the Samaritans.


## Matthew 10:6 (id: 940010006)

6But go instead to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.


## Matthew 10:7 (id: 940010007)

7Now {as} you are going, preach, saying, ‘The kingdom of the heavens has come near.’


## Matthew 10:8 (id: 940010008)

8Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, {and} cast out demons. Freely you have received; freely give.


## Matthew 10:9 (id: 940010009)

9Do not acquire gold or silver or copper in your belts,


## Matthew 10:10 (id: 940010010)

10nor a bag for the road nor two tunics nor sandals nor a staff, for the laborer {is} worthy of his food.


## Matthew 10:11 (id: 940010011)

11But whatever city or village you enter into, find someone who is worthy in it and stay there until you go out.


## Matthew 10:12 (id: 940010012)

12Now entering into the house, greet it.


## Matthew 10:13 (id: 940010013)

13And if indeed the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it, but if it is not worthy, let your peace be returned to you.


## Matthew 10:14 (id: 940010014)

14And whoever does not receive you nor listen to your words, departing from that house or city, shake off the dust from your feet.


## Matthew 10:15 (id: 940010015)

15Truly I say to you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.


## Matthew 10:16 (id: 940010016)

16Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves, so become wise as the serpents and harmless as the doves.


## Matthew 10:17 (id: 940010017)

17But beware of the men, for they will hand you over to councils, and they will whip you in their synagogues;


## Matthew 10:18 (id: 940010018)

18and you will be brought also before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them and to the Gentiles.


## Matthew 10:19 (id: 940010019)

19But when they hand you over, do not worry about how or what you will speak, for what you will say will be given to you in that hour.


## Matthew 10:20 (id: 940010020)

20For you are not the one speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.


## Matthew 10:21 (id: 940010021)

21Now brother will hand over brother to death, and a father, his child, and children will rise up against parents and put them to death.


## Matthew 10:22 (id: 940010022)

22And you will be hated by all because of my name, but the one having endured to the end, this one will be saved.


## Matthew 10:23 (id: 940010023)

23But whenever they persecute you in this city, flee to the next, for truly I say to you, you will certainly not finish the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.


## Matthew 10:24 (id: 940010024)

24A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a slave above his master.


## Matthew 10:25 (id: 940010025)

25It is enough for the disciple that he might be like his teacher, and the slave like his master. If they called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much worse the members of his household!


## Matthew 10:26 (id: 940010026)

26Therefore, do not fear them, for there is nothing concealed that will not be revealed, and hidden, that will not be made known.


## Matthew 10:27 (id: 940010027)

27What I tell you in the darkness, say in the light, and what you hear in your ear, proclaim upon the housetops.


## Matthew 10:28 (id: 940010028)

28And do not be afraid of the ones killing the body but not being able to kill the soul. But instead, fear the one being able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.


## Matthew 10:29 (id: 940010029)

29Are not two sparrows sold for an assarion? And yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father.


## Matthew 10:30 (id: 940010030)

30But even the hairs of your head are all numbered.


## Matthew 10:31 (id: 940010031)

31Therefore, do not fear; you are more valuable than many sparrows.


## Matthew 10:32 (id: 940010032)

32Therefore, everyone who will confess about me before men, I will also confess about him before my Father in the heavens.


## Matthew 10:33 (id: 940010033)

33But whoever denies me before men, I will also deny him before my Father in the heavens.


## Matthew 10:34 (id: 940010034)

34Do not think that I came to bring peace upon the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.


## Matthew 10:35 (id: 940010035)

35For I came to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter\-in\-law against her mother\-in\-law;


## Matthew 10:36 (id: 940010036)

36and the enemies of a man {will be} the ones of his household.


## Matthew 10:37 (id: 940010037)

37The one loving father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and the one loving son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.


## Matthew 10:38 (id: 940010038)

38And whoever does not take up his cross and follow after me is not worthy of me.


## Matthew 10:39 (id: 940010039)

39The one having found his life will lose it, and the one having lost his life for my sake will find it.


## Matthew 10:40 (id: 940010040)

40The one receiving you receives me, and the one receiving me receives the one having sent me.


## Matthew 10:41 (id: 940010041)

41The one receiving a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a reward of a prophet, and the one receiving a righteous {man} in the name of a righteous {man} will receive a reward of a righteous {man}.


## Matthew 10:42 (id: 940010042)

42And whoever gives to one of these little ones a cup of cold water to drink only in the name of a disciple, truly I say to you, he will certainly not lose his reward.”


## Matthew 11:1 (id: 940011001)

1And it happened that when Jesus had finished giving orders to his 12 disciples, he departed from there to teach and to preach in their cities.


## Matthew 11:2 (id: 940011002)

2Now John, having heard in the prison about the deeds of Christ, having sent through his disciples,


## Matthew 11:3 (id: 940011003)

3said to him, “Are you the one coming, or should we expect another?”


## Matthew 11:4 (id: 940011004)

4And answering, Jesus said to them, “Having gone, report to John what you hear and see.


## Matthew 11:5 (id: 940011005)

5The blind see again, and the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised, and the poor are being told the gospel.


## Matthew 11:6 (id: 940011006)

6And blessed is whoever is not caused to stumble on me.”


## Matthew 11:7 (id: 940011007)

7Now {as} these were going on their way, Jesus began to say to the crowds concerning John, “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?


## Matthew 11:8 (id: 940011008)

8But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Behold, the ones wearing soft clothing are in the houses of the kings.


## Matthew 11:9 (id: 940011009)

9But why did you go out? To see a prophet? Yes, I say to you, and more than a prophet.


## Matthew 11:10 (id: 940011010)

10This is he concerning whom it is written, ‘Behold, I am sending my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.’


## Matthew 11:11 (id: 940011011)

11Truly I say to you, among those born of women there has not arisen one greater than John the Baptist, but the least in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he.


## Matthew 11:12 (id: 940011012)

12But from the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of the heavens suffers violence, and violent men take it by force.


## Matthew 11:13 (id: 940011013)

13For all the Prophets and the Law have prophesied until John;


## Matthew 11:14 (id: 940011014)

14and if you are willing to accept {it}, he is Elijah, the one being about to come.


## Matthew 11:15 (id: 940011015)

15The one having ears to hear, let him hear.


## Matthew 11:16 (id: 940011016)

16Now to what will I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplace, who are calling out to the others,


## Matthew 11:17 (id: 940011017)

17saying, ‘We played a flute for you, and you did not dance. We sang a funeral song, and you did not mourn.’


## Matthew 11:18 (id: 940011018)

18For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon.’


## Matthew 11:19 (id: 940011019)

19The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‘Behold a man, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ But wisdom has been justified by her children.”


## Matthew 11:20 (id: 940011020)

20Then he began to rebuke the cities in which most of his miracles were done, because they had not repented.


## Matthew 11:21 (id: 940011021)

21“Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles had happened in Tyre and Sidon which happened in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.


## Matthew 11:22 (id: 940011022)

22Nevertheless, I say to you, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you.


## Matthew 11:23 (id: 940011023)

23And you, Capernaum, you will not be exalted to heaven, will you? You will be brought down as far as Hades. For if the miracles that happened in you had happened in Sodom, it would have remained until today.


## Matthew 11:24 (id: 940011024)

24Nevertheless, I say to you that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for you.”


## Matthew 11:25 (id: 940011025)

25At that time, answering, Jesus said, “I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you concealed these things from the wise and intelligent and revealed them to little children.


## Matthew 11:26 (id: 940011026)

26Yes, Father, for thus it was well\-pleasing before you.


## Matthew 11:27 (id: 940011027)

27All things have been handed over to me by my Father; and no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son, and to whomever the Son desires to reveal him.


## Matthew 11:28 (id: 940011028)

28Come to me, all the ones laboring and heavy burdened, and I will give you rest.


## Matthew 11:29 (id: 940011029)

29Take my yoke on you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.


## Matthew 11:30 (id: 940011030)

30For my yoke {is} easy and my burden is light.”


## Matthew 12:1 (id: 940012001)

1At that time Jesus went on the Sabbaths through the grainfields, but his disciples were hungry and began to pick heads of grain and to eat {them}.


## Matthew 12:2 (id: 940012002)

2But the Pharisees, having seen this, said to him, “Behold, your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on a Sabbath.”


## Matthew 12:3 (id: 940012003)

3But he said to them, “Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and the ones with him—


## Matthew 12:4 (id: 940012004)

4how he went into the house of God and ate the loaves of the Presence, which was not lawful for him to eat nor for the ones with him, except only for the priests?


## Matthew 12:5 (id: 940012005)

5Or have you not read in the law that on the Sabbaths the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath, but are innocent?


## Matthew 12:6 (id: 940012006)

6But I say to you that something greater than the temple is here.


## Matthew 12:7 (id: 940012007)

7But if you had known what this is, ‘I desire mercy and not sacrifice,’ you would not have condemned the innocent.


## Matthew 12:8 (id: 940012008)

8For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.”


## Matthew 12:9 (id: 940012009)

9And having departed from there, he went into their synagogue.


## Matthew 12:10 (id: 940012010)

10And behold, a man having a withered hand, and they questioned him, saying, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbaths?” so that they might accuse him.


## Matthew 12:11 (id: 940012011)

11But he said to them, “What man will there be among you who will have one sheep, and if it might fall into a pit on the Sabbaths, will not grasp hold of it and lift {it} out?


## Matthew 12:12 (id: 940012012)

12How much more valuable, then, {is} a man than a sheep? Therefore, it is lawful to do good on the Sabbaths.”


## Matthew 12:13 (id: 940012013)

13Then he says to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” And he stretched {it} out, and it was restored to health, just like the other.


## Matthew 12:14 (id: 940012014)

14But having gone out, the Pharisees took counsel against him so that they might destroy him.


## Matthew 12:15 (id: 940012015)

15But Jesus, having perceived this, withdrew from there. And many followed him, and he healed them all,


## Matthew 12:16 (id: 940012016)

16and he rebuked them so that they might not make him known,


## Matthew 12:17 (id: 940012017)

17so that it might be fulfilled what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,


## Matthew 12:18 (id: 940012018)

18“Behold, my servant whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul was well pleased. I will put my Spirit upon him, and he will announce justice to the Gentiles.


## Matthew 12:19 (id: 940012019)

19He will not strive nor cry aloud; neither will anyone hear his voice in the streets.


## Matthew 12:20 (id: 940012020)

20He will not break a bruised reed; and he will not quench a smoking flax, until he casts out justice to victory,


## Matthew 12:21 (id: 940012021)

21and in his name Gentiles will hope.”


## Matthew 12:22 (id: 940012022)

22Then one being demon\-possessed was brought to him, blind and mute, and he healed him, so that the mute one spoke and saw.


## Matthew 12:23 (id: 940012023)

23And all the crowds were amazed and were saying, “Is this not the Son of David?”


## Matthew 12:24 (id: 940012024)

24But the Pharisees, having heard this, said, “He does not cast out demons except by Beelzebul, ruler of the demons.”


## Matthew 12:25 (id: 940012025)

25But having known their thoughts, he said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself is made desolate, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand.


## Matthew 12:26 (id: 940012026)

26And if Satan casts out Satan, he has been divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?


## Matthew 12:27 (id: 940012027)

27And if I cast out the demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Because of this they will be your judges.


## Matthew 12:28 (id: 940012028)

28But if I cast out the demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.


## Matthew 12:29 (id: 940012029)

29Or how is anyone able to enter into the house of the strong man and steal his possessions if he has not first bound the strong man? And then he will plunder his house.


## Matthew 12:30 (id: 940012030)

30The one not being with me is against me, and the one not gathering with me scatters.


## Matthew 12:31 (id: 940012031)

31For this reason I say to you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy of the Spirit will not be forgiven.


## Matthew 12:32 (id: 940012032)

32And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him. But whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, neither in this age, nor in the one coming.


## Matthew 12:33 (id: 940012033)

33Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree rotten and its fruit rotten, for the tree is known by its fruit.


## Matthew 12:34 (id: 940012034)

34You offspring of vipers, being evil, how are you able to say good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.


## Matthew 12:35 (id: 940012035)

35The good man from his good treasure brings forth good things, and the evil man from his evil treasure brings forth evil things.


## Matthew 12:36 (id: 940012036)

36But I say to you that every careless word that men will speak, they will give an account concerning it in the day of judgment.


## Matthew 12:37 (id: 940012037)

37For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.”


## Matthew 12:38 (id: 940012038)

38Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying, “Teacher, we wish to see a sign from you.”


## Matthew 12:39 (id: 940012039)

39But answering, he said to them, “An evil and adulterous generation seeks a sign, but a sign will not be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet.


## Matthew 12:40 (id: 940012040)

40For just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the big fish, in this manner the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.


## Matthew 12:41 (id: 940012041)

41The men of Nineveh will rise up in the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah {is} here.


## Matthew 12:42 (id: 940012042)

42The Queen of the South will stand up in the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon {is} here.


## Matthew 12:43 (id: 940012043)

43Now when the unclean spirit has gone out from the man, it passes through waterless places seeking rest, and it does not find any.


## Matthew 12:44 (id: 940012044)

44Then it says, ‘I will return to my house from which I came out.’ And having come, it finds {it} being empty, having been swept out and put in order.


## Matthew 12:45 (id: 940012045)

45Then it goes and takes along with itself seven other spirits more evil than itself and they having entered, it resides there. And the last things of that man become worse than the first things. Thus it will be also with this evil generation.”


## Matthew 12:46 (id: 940012046)

46{While} he was still speaking to the crowds, behold, his mother and brothers had stood outside, seeking to speak to him.


## Matthew 12:47 (id: 940012047)

47Now someone said to him, “Behold, your mother and your brothers have stood outside, seeking to speak to you.”


## Matthew 12:48 (id: 940012048)

48But answering, he said to the one speaking to him, “Who is my mother and who are my brothers?”


## Matthew 12:49 (id: 940012049)

49And having stretched out his hand toward his disciples, he said, “Behold, my mother and my brothers!


## Matthew 12:50 (id: 940012050)

50For whoever does the will of my Father in the heavens, he is my brother and sister and mother.”


## Matthew 13:1 (id: 940013001)

1On that day, Jesus, having gone out of the house, was sitting beside the sea.


## Matthew 13:2 (id: 940013002)

2And large crowds were gathered to him. As a result, having gotten into a boat, he sat down, and the whole crowd stood on the beach.


## Matthew 13:3 (id: 940013003)

3And he spoke many things to them in parables, saying, “Behold, the sower went out to sow.


## Matthew 13:4 (id: 940013004)

4And as he sowed, some fell beside the road, and the birds came and devoured them.


## Matthew 13:5 (id: 940013005)

5But others fell on the rocky ground, where it did not have much soil, and immediately it sprang up, because it did not have deep soil.


## Matthew 13:6 (id: 940013006)

6But {when} the sun had risen, it was scorched, and because it had no root, it withered.


## Matthew 13:7 (id: 940013007)

7But others fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them.


## Matthew 13:8 (id: 940013008)

8But others fell on good soil and were giving fruit, some 100, and some 60, and some 30\.


## Matthew 13:9 (id: 940013009)

9The one having ears, let him hear.”


## Matthew 13:10 (id: 940013010)

10And having approached, the disciples said to him, “For what reason do you speak to them in parables?”


## Matthew 13:11 (id: 940013011)

11But he, answering, said to them, “To you has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens, but to those it has not been given.


## Matthew 13:12 (id: 940013012)

12For whoever has, it will be given to him, and he will have an abundance. But whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.


## Matthew 13:13 (id: 940013013)

13For this reason I speak to them in parables; because seeing, they do not see; and hearing, they do not hear nor understand.


## Matthew 13:14 (id: 940013014)

14And in them the prophecy of Isaiah is being fulfilled, which says, ‘In hearing you will hear, but you will certainly not understand; and seeing, you will see, but you will certainly not perceive.


## Matthew 13:15 (id: 940013015)

15For the heart of this people has been thickened, and with {their} ears they have hardly heard, and they have shut their eyes, lest they might see with {their} eyes, and they might hear with {their} ears, and they might understand with {their} heart and turn back, and I would heal them.’


## Matthew 13:16 (id: 940013016)

16But blessed {are} your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.


## Matthew 13:17 (id: 940013017)

17For truly I say to you that many prophets and righteous ones longed to see what you see, and did not see, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear.


## Matthew 13:18 (id: 940013018)

18You, therefore, listen to the parable of the sower.


## Matthew 13:19 (id: 940013019)

19Everyone hearing the word of the kingdom and not understanding, the evil one comes and snatches away {what} had been sown in his heart. This is {what} was sown beside the road.


## Matthew 13:20 (id: 940013020)

20Now the one having been sown on the rocky ground, this is the one hearing the word and immediately receiving it with joy;


## Matthew 13:21 (id: 940013021)

21but he has no root in himself but is temporary; and tribulation or persecution having happened because of the word, immediately he is caused to stumble.


## Matthew 13:22 (id: 940013022)

22Now the one having been sown among the thorns, this is the one hearing the word, but the worry of this age and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.


## Matthew 13:23 (id: 940013023)

23Now the one having been sown on the good soil, this is the one hearing the word and understanding {it}, who indeed bears fruit and yields, some 100, and some 60, and some 30\.”


## Matthew 13:24 (id: 940013024)

24He set before them another parable, saying, “The kingdom of the heavens is compared to a man having sown good seed in his field.


## Matthew 13:25 (id: 940013025)

25But while the men slept, his enemy came and sowed darnel among the wheat and went away.


## Matthew 13:26 (id: 940013026)

26Now when the blades sprouted and produced a crop, then the darnel became visible also.


## Matthew 13:27 (id: 940013027)

27Now the servants of the master of the house, having approached, said to him, ‘Master, did you not sow good seed in your field? From where then does it have darnel?’


## Matthew 13:28 (id: 940013028)

28But he was saying to them, ‘A hostile man did this.’ But the servants say to him, ‘Do you therefore desire that, having gone out, we would gather them?’


## Matthew 13:29 (id: 940013029)

29But he says, ‘Certainly not, lest gathering the darnel, you might uproot the wheat along with them.


## Matthew 13:30 (id: 940013030)

30Permit both to grow together until the harvest, and at the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, “First gather the darnel and tie them in bundles to burn them up but gather the wheat into my barn.”’”


## Matthew 13:31 (id: 940013031)

31He set before them another parable, saying, “The kingdom of the heavens is like a mustard seed which, having taken, a man sowed in his field;


## Matthew 13:32 (id: 940013032)

32which is indeed the smallest of all the seeds, but when it grows, it is greater than the vegetable plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the sky come and nest in its branches.”


## Matthew 13:33 (id: 940013033)

33He spoke to them another parable: “The kingdom of the heavens is like yeast that a woman, having taken, mixed with three seahs of flour until it was all leavened.”


## Matthew 13:34 (id: 940013034)

34All these things Jesus spoke in parables to the crowds, and he was speaking nothing to them without a parable,


## Matthew 13:35 (id: 940013035)

35so that {what} had been said through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, “I will open my mouth in parables. I will declare {what} has been hidden from the foundation of the world.”


## Matthew 13:36 (id: 940013036)

36Then, having left the crowds, he went into the house. And his disciples approached him, saying, “Explain to us the parable of the darnel of the field.”


## Matthew 13:37 (id: 940013037)

37Now answering, he said, “The one sowing the good seed is the Son of Man,


## Matthew 13:38 (id: 940013038)

38and the field is the world, and the good seed—these are the sons of the kingdom. And the darnel are the sons of the evil one,


## Matthew 13:39 (id: 940013039)

39and the enemy having sowed them is the devil. And the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels.


## Matthew 13:40 (id: 940013040)

40Therefore, just as the darnel are gathered and burned with fire, thus it will be at the end of the age.


## Matthew 13:41 (id: 940013041)

41The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will gather from his kingdom all the stumbling blocks and the ones doing lawlessness.


## Matthew 13:42 (id: 940013042)

42And they will throw them into the furnace of fire, where there will be weeping and grinding of the teeth.


## Matthew 13:43 (id: 940013043)

43Then the righteous will shine as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. The one having ears, let him hear.


## Matthew 13:44 (id: 940013044)

44The kingdom of the heavens is like a treasure hidden in a field, which, having found, a man hid. And from his joy, he goes and sells everything, as much as he has, and buys that field.


## Matthew 13:45 (id: 940013045)

45Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a man, a merchant, seeking fine pearls.


## Matthew 13:46 (id: 940013046)

46And having found one very valuable pearl, having gone away, he sold everything, as much as he had, and bought it.


## Matthew 13:47 (id: 940013047)

47Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a net having been cast into the sea, and having gathered from every kind,


## Matthew 13:48 (id: 940013048)

48which, when it was filled, having dragged onto the beach, and having sat down, they gathered the good things into containers, but the rotten things they threw out.


## Matthew 13:49 (id: 940013049)

49Thus it will be at the end of the age: The angels will go out and will separate the wicked from among the righteous,


## Matthew 13:50 (id: 940013050)

50and they will throw them into the furnace of fire, where there will be weeping and grinding of the teeth.


## Matthew 13:51 (id: 940013051)

51Have you understood all these things?” They say to him, “Yes.”


## Matthew 13:52 (id: 940013052)

52Now he said to them, “For this reason, every scribe having been discipled for the kingdom of the heavens is like a man, the master of the house, who brings forth new and old from his treasure.”


## Matthew 13:53 (id: 940013053)

53And it happened that when Jesus finished these parables, he departed from there.


## Matthew 13:54 (id: 940013054)

54And having come to his hometown, he was teaching them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished and say, “From where to this one {is} this wisdom and these miracles?


## Matthew 13:55 (id: 940013055)

55Is not this the son of the carpenter? Is not his mother called Mary, and his brothers, James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?


## Matthew 13:56 (id: 940013056)

56And are not all his sisters with us? From where, therefore, to this one {are} all these things?”


## Matthew 13:57 (id: 940013057)

57And they were being caused to stumble on him. But Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and in his house.”


## Matthew 13:58 (id: 940013058)

58And he did not do many miracles there, because of their unbelief.


## Matthew 14:1 (id: 940014001)

1At that time, Herod the tetrarch heard the news about Jesus.


## Matthew 14:2 (id: 940014002)

2And he said to his servants, “This is John the Baptist. He has been raised from the dead, and because of this the powers work in him.”


## Matthew 14:3 (id: 940014003)

3For Herod, having seized John, bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip.


## Matthew 14:4 (id: 940014004)

4For John was saying to him, “It is not lawful for you to have her.”


## Matthew 14:5 (id: 940014005)

5And wanting to put him to death, he feared the crowd, because they were regarding him as a prophet.


## Matthew 14:6 (id: 940014006)

6But the birthday of Herod having come, the daughter of Herodias danced in the midst and pleased Herod,


## Matthew 14:7 (id: 940014007)

7because of which he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked.


## Matthew 14:8 (id: 940014008)

8Now she, having been urged beforehand by her mother, said, “Give me here, on a platter, the head of John the Baptist.”


## Matthew 14:9 (id: 940014009)

9And the king was grieved, {but} because of the oaths and the ones reclining to eat with him, he commanded {it} to be given.


## Matthew 14:10 (id: 940014010)

10And having sent, he beheaded John in the prison.


## Matthew 14:11 (id: 940014011)

11And his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought {it} to her mother.


## Matthew 14:12 (id: 940014012)

12And having approached, his disciples took away the corpse and buried him. And having come, they reported {this} to Jesus.


## Matthew 14:13 (id: 940014013)

13Now having heard, Jesus withdrew from there in a boat to a desolate place by himself. And having heard, the crowds followed him on foot from the cities.


## Matthew 14:14 (id: 940014014)

14And having come out, he saw a large crowd, and he had compassion on them and healed their sick.


## Matthew 14:15 (id: 940014015)

15Now evening having come, the disciples came to him, saying, “This place is desolate, and the hour has already passed by. Send the crowds away so that, having gone away to the villages, they might buy food for themselves.”


## Matthew 14:16 (id: 940014016)

16But Jesus said to them, “They have no need to go away. You give them to eat.”


## Matthew 14:17 (id: 940014017)

17But they say to him, “We have nothing here except five loaves and two fish.”


## Matthew 14:18 (id: 940014018)

18But he said, “Bring them here to me.”


## Matthew 14:19 (id: 940014019)

19And having commanded the crowds to recline on the grass, having taken the five loaves and the two fish, having looked up to heaven, he blessed, and having broken {them}, he gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples to the crowds.


## Matthew 14:20 (id: 940014020)

20And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up the remaining of the broken pieces—12 baskets full.


## Matthew 14:21 (id: 940014021)

21Now the ones eating were about 5,000 men, besides women and children.


## Matthew 14:22 (id: 940014022)

22And immediately he compelled the disciples to get into the boat and to go before him to the other side, while he sent the crowds away.


## Matthew 14:23 (id: 940014023)

23And having sent the crowds away, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. Now evening having come, he was there alone.


## Matthew 14:24 (id: 940014024)

24But the boat was already in the middle of the sea, being tormented by the waves, for the wind was against {it}.


## Matthew 14:25 (id: 940014025)

25Now in the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea.


## Matthew 14:26 (id: 940014026)

26But the disciples, having seen him walking on the sea, were greatly troubled, saying, “It is a ghost,” and they cried out from fear.


## Matthew 14:27 (id: 940014027)

27But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, “Take courage! It is I! Do not be afraid.”


## Matthew 14:28 (id: 940014028)

28But answering him, Peter said, “Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water.”


## Matthew 14:29 (id: 940014029)

29And he said, “Come.” And Peter, having gotten out from the boat, walked on the water to go to Jesus.


## Matthew 14:30 (id: 940014030)

30But seeing the strong wind, he became afraid, and having begun to sink, he cried out, saying, “Lord, save me!”


## Matthew 14:31 (id: 940014031)

31But immediately, Jesus, having stretched out his hand, took hold of him, and says to him, “You of little faith, why did you doubt?”


## Matthew 14:32 (id: 940014032)

32And {when} they had gotten into the boat, the wind ceased.


## Matthew 14:33 (id: 940014033)

33And the ones in the boat worshiped him, saying, “Truly you are the Son of God.”


## Matthew 14:34 (id: 940014034)

34And having crossed over, they came to the land at Gennesaret.


## Matthew 14:35 (id: 940014035)

35And having recognized him, the men of that place sent into all that surrounding area, and they brought to him all the ones having sickness.


## Matthew 14:36 (id: 940014036)

36And they were begging him so that they might only touch the edge of his garment, and as many as touched {it} were healed.


## Matthew 15:1 (id: 940015001)

1Then Pharisees and scribes come to Jesus from Jerusalem, saying,


## Matthew 15:2 (id: 940015002)

2“Why do your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.”


## Matthew 15:3 (id: 940015003)

3But he, answering, said to them, “Why do you also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition?


## Matthew 15:4 (id: 940015004)

4For God commanded, saying, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and ‘The one speaking evil of his father or mother, let him end in death.’


## Matthew 15:5 (id: 940015005)

5But you say, ‘Whoever says to his father or mother, “Whatever you might have benefited from me {is} a gift,”


## Matthew 15:6 (id: 940015006)

6he will certainly not honor his father.’ And you have set aside the word of God because of your tradition.


## Matthew 15:7 (id: 940015007)

7Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied well about you, saying,


## Matthew 15:8 (id: 940015008)

8‘This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far away from me.


## Matthew 15:9 (id: 940015009)

9But they worship me in vain, teaching as doctrines commandments of men.’”


## Matthew 15:10 (id: 940015010)

10And having summoned the crowd, he said to them, “Listen and understand:


## Matthew 15:11 (id: 940015011)

11What enters into the mouth does not defile the man, but what comes out from the mouth, this defiles the man.”


## Matthew 15:12 (id: 940015012)

12Then having approached, the disciples said to him, “Do you know that the Pharisees, having heard this word, were caused to stumble?”


## Matthew 15:13 (id: 940015013)

13But he, answering, said, “Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted.


## Matthew 15:14 (id: 940015014)

14Leave them! They are blind guides. But if a blind one guides a blind one, both will fall into a pit.”


## Matthew 15:15 (id: 940015015)

15But answering, Peter said to him, “Explain the parable to us.”


## Matthew 15:16 (id: 940015016)

16But he said, “Are you also still without understanding?


## Matthew 15:17 (id: 940015017)

17Do you not yet understand that everything that enters into the mouth passes into the stomach and is passed out into the latrine?


## Matthew 15:18 (id: 940015018)

18But the things coming out from the mouth come from the heart, and those defile the man.


## Matthew 15:19 (id: 940015019)

19For from the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adultery, sexual immorality, thefts, false testimony, blasphemies.


## Matthew 15:20 (id: 940015020)

20These are the things defiling the man, but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile the man.”


## Matthew 15:21 (id: 940015021)

21And having come out from there, Jesus withdrew into the regions of Tyre and Sidon.


## Matthew 15:22 (id: 940015022)

22And behold, a Canaanite woman, having come out from those regions, was crying out, saying, “Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter is severely demon\-possessed.”


## Matthew 15:23 (id: 940015023)

23But he did not answer her a word. And having approached, his disciples were begging him, saying, “Send her away, for she is crying out after us.”


## Matthew 15:24 (id: 940015024)

24But he, answering, said, “I was not sent, except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”


## Matthew 15:25 (id: 940015025)

25But she, having come, bowed down to him, saying, “Lord, help me.”


## Matthew 15:26 (id: 940015026)

26Now he, answering, said, “It is not good to take the bread of the children and to throw {it} to the little dogs.”


## Matthew 15:27 (id: 940015027)

27But she said, “Yes, Lord, for also the little dogs eat from the crumbs falling from the table of their masters.”


## Matthew 15:28 (id: 940015028)

28Then answering, Jesus said to her, “O woman, great {is} your faith; let it be done for you just as you desire.” And her daughter was healed from that hour.


## Matthew 15:29 (id: 940015029)

29And having left from there, Jesus went along the Sea of Galilee, and having gone up on a mountain, he was sitting there.


## Matthew 15:30 (id: 940015030)

30And large crowds approached him, having with them the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute, and many others. And they laid them at his feet, and he healed them,


## Matthew 15:31 (id: 940015031)

31so that the crowd marveled, seeing the mute speaking, the crippled healthy, and the lame walking, and the blind seeing, and they glorified the God of Israel.


## Matthew 15:32 (id: 940015032)

32But Jesus, having summoned his disciples, said, “I have compassion on the crowd, because they are remaining with me already three days and do not have anything {that} they might eat. And I do not want to send them away hungry, lest they might faint on the way.”


## Matthew 15:33 (id: 940015033)

33And the disciples say to him, “From where {would be} to us in a desolate place so many loaves so as to satisfy so large a crowd?”


## Matthew 15:34 (id: 940015034)

34And Jesus says to them, “How many loaves do you have?” And they said, “Seven, and a few small fish.”


## Matthew 15:35 (id: 940015035)

35And having commanded the crowd to recline on the ground,


## Matthew 15:36 (id: 940015036)

36he took the seven loaves and the fish, and having given thanks, he broke {them} and was giving {them} to the disciples, and the disciples to the crowds.


## Matthew 15:37 (id: 940015037)

37And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up the remaining of the broken pieces—seven baskets full.


## Matthew 15:38 (id: 940015038)

38But those eating were 4,000 men, besides women and children.


## Matthew 15:39 (id: 940015039)

39And having sent away the crowds, he got into the boat and went into the regions of Magadan.


## Matthew 16:1 (id: 940016001)

1And the Pharisees and Sadducees, having approached, testing {him}, asked him to show them a sign from heaven.


## Matthew 16:2 (id: 940016002)

2But he answering said to them, “\[Evening having come, you say, ‘It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.’


## Matthew 16:3 (id: 940016003)

3And in early morning, ‘Today will be stormy, for the sky is red, being overcast.’ You know to interpret the face of the sky, but the signs of the times you are not able.]


## Matthew 16:4 (id: 940016004)

4An evil and adulterous generation seeks a sign, but a sign will not be given to it except the sign of Jonah.” And having left them, he went away.


## Matthew 16:5 (id: 940016005)

5And the disciples, having come to the other side, forgot to take loaves.


## Matthew 16:6 (id: 940016006)

6Now Jesus said to them, “See and guard from the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”


## Matthew 16:7 (id: 940016007)

7But they were reasoning among themselves, saying, “{It is} because we did not take loaves.”


## Matthew 16:8 (id: 940016008)

8But having known this, Jesus said, “You of little faith, why are you reasoning among yourselves that you do not have loaves?


## Matthew 16:9 (id: 940016009)

9Do you not yet perceive nor remember the five loaves of the 5,000, and how many baskets you received?


## Matthew 16:10 (id: 940016010)

10Nor the seven loaves of the 4,000, and how many baskets you received?


## Matthew 16:11 (id: 940016011)

11How do you not perceive that I did not speak to you about loaves? But guard from the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”


## Matthew 16:12 (id: 940016012)

12Then they understood that he had not told them to guard from the yeast of loaves, but from the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.


## Matthew 16:13 (id: 940016013)

13Now Jesus, having come to the regions of Caesarea Philippi, asked his disciples, saying, “Who do men say the Son of Man is?”


## Matthew 16:14 (id: 940016014)

14And they said, “Some, John the Baptist; and some, Elijah; and others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.”


## Matthew 16:15 (id: 940016015)

15He says to them, “But who do you say I am?”


## Matthew 16:16 (id: 940016016)

16And answering, Simon Peter said, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”


## Matthew 16:17 (id: 940016017)

17Now answering, Jesus said to him, “Blessed are you, Simon Bar Jonah, because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but my Father in the heavens.


## Matthew 16:18 (id: 940016018)

18And I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it.


## Matthew 16:19 (id: 940016019)

19I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, and whatever you bind on the earth will have been bound in the heavens, and whatever you loose on the earth will have been loosed in the heavens.”


## Matthew 16:20 (id: 940016020)

20Then he commanded the disciples that they tell no one that he is the Christ.


## Matthew 16:21 (id: 940016021)

21From that time Jesus Christ began to show to his disciples that it is necessary for him to go to Jerusalem and to suffer much from the elders and chief priests and scribes and to be killed and to be raised on the third day.


## Matthew 16:22 (id: 940016022)

22And having taken him aside, Peter began to rebuke him, saying, “Merciful to you, Lord; this will certainly not be to you.”


## Matthew 16:23 (id: 940016023)

23But, he, having turned, said to Peter, “Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me, because you are not considering the things of God, but the things of men.”


## Matthew 16:24 (id: 940016024)

24Then Jesus said to his disciples, “If anyone wants to come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.


## Matthew 16:25 (id: 940016025)

25For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.


## Matthew 16:26 (id: 940016026)

26For what will a man benefit if he gains the whole world but forfeits his life? Or what will a man give in exchange for his life?


## Matthew 16:27 (id: 940016027)

27For the Son of Man is about to come in the glory of his Father with his angels. And then he will repay each one according to his action.


## Matthew 16:28 (id: 940016028)

28Truly I say to you that there are some of the ones standing here who will certainly not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.”


## Matthew 17:1 (id: 940017001)

1And after six days, Jesus takes along Peter, and James, and John his brother, and brings them up onto a high mountain by themselves.


## Matthew 17:2 (id: 940017002)

2And he was transfigured before them, and his face shone as the sun, and his garments became white as the light.


## Matthew 17:3 (id: 940017003)

3And behold, Moses and Elijah were seen by them, talking with him.


## Matthew 17:4 (id: 940017004)

4And answering, Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, I will make here three tents, one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”


## Matthew 17:5 (id: 940017005)

5{While} he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and behold, a voice from the cloud, saying, “This is my beloved Son with whom I am well pleased. Listen to him.”


## Matthew 17:6 (id: 940017006)

6And having heard, the disciples fell on their face and were very afraid.


## Matthew 17:7 (id: 940017007)

7And Jesus approached and having touched them, said, “Get up and do not be afraid.”


## Matthew 17:8 (id: 940017008)

8But having lifted up their eyes, they saw no one except only Jesus himself.


## Matthew 17:9 (id: 940017009)

9And {as} they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, “Tell the vision to no one until the Son of Man might have risen from the dead.”


## Matthew 17:10 (id: 940017010)

10And his disciples questioned him, saying, “Why then do the scribes say that it is necessary for Elijah to come first?”


## Matthew 17:11 (id: 940017011)

11But he, answering, said, “Elijah indeed comes and will restore all things.


## Matthew 17:12 (id: 940017012)

12But I say to you that Elijah already came, and they did not recognize him, but they did to him whatever they wanted. In the same way also, the Son of Man is about to suffer by them.”


## Matthew 17:13 (id: 940017013)

13Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them about John the Baptist.


## Matthew 17:14 (id: 940017014)

14And having come to the crowd, a man approached him, kneeling before him


## Matthew 17:15 (id: 940017015)

15and saying, “Lord, have mercy on my son, because he is epileptic and has sickness, for he often falls into the fire and often into the water.


## Matthew 17:16 (id: 940017016)

16And I brought him to your disciples, and they were not able to heal him.”


## Matthew 17:17 (id: 940017017)

17But answering, Jesus said, “O unbelieving and perverted generation, until when will I be with you? Until when will I bear with you? Bring him here to me.”


## Matthew 17:18 (id: 940017018)

18And Jesus rebuked it, and the demon came out from him, and the boy was healed from that hour.


## Matthew 17:19 (id: 940017019)

19Then the disciples, having approached Jesus privately, said, “For what reason were we not able to cast it out?”


## Matthew 17:20 (id: 940017020)

20And he says to them, “Because of your little faith. For truly I say to you, if you had faith like a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you.


## Matthew 17:21 (id: 940017021)

21\[But this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting.]”


## Matthew 17:22 (id: 940017022)

22Now they being gathered together in Galilee, Jesus said to them, “The Son of Man is about to be handed over into the hands of men,


## Matthew 17:23 (id: 940017023)

23and they will kill him, and on the third day he will be raised up.” And they were very grieved.


## Matthew 17:24 (id: 940017024)

24Now {when} they had come to Capernaum, the ones collecting the two\-drachma tax approached Peter and said, “Does not your teacher pay the two\-drachma tax?”


## Matthew 17:25 (id: 940017025)

25He says, “Yes.” And having entered into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, “What do you think, Simon? The kings of the earth—from whom do they receive taxes or tolls? From their sons or from strangers?”


## Matthew 17:26 (id: 940017026)

26But having said, “From strangers,” Jesus said to him, “Therefore, the sons are free.


## Matthew 17:27 (id: 940017027)

27But in order that we might not cause them to stumble, having gone to the sea, throw in a fishhook, and draw in the first fish having come up. And having opened its mouth, you will find a shekel. Having taken that, give {it} to them on behalf of me and you.”


## Matthew 18:1 (id: 940018001)

1At that hour the disciples approached Jesus, saying, “Who then is greatest in the kingdom of the heavens?”


## Matthew 18:2 (id: 940018002)

2And having summoned a little child, he set him in the midst of them


## Matthew 18:3 (id: 940018003)

3and said, “Truly I say to you, unless you turn and become like little children, you will certainly not enter into the kingdom of the heavens.


## Matthew 18:4 (id: 940018004)

4Therefore, whoever will humble himself like this little child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens.


## Matthew 18:5 (id: 940018005)

5And whoever receives a little child like this in my name receives me.


## Matthew 18:6 (id: 940018006)

6But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it is better for him that a millstone of a donkey would have been hung around his neck and he would have been sunk into the depth of the sea.


## Matthew 18:7 (id: 940018007)

7Woe to the world because of the stumbling blocks! For it is necessary that the stumbling blocks come, but woe to the man through whom the stumbling block comes!


## Matthew 18:8 (id: 940018008)

8Now if your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw {it} away from you. It is better for you to enter into life crippled or lame than, having two hands or two feet, to be thrown into the eternal fire.


## Matthew 18:9 (id: 940018009)

9And if your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw {it} away from you. It is better for you to enter into life with one eye than, having two eyes, to be thrown into the Gehenna of fire.


## Matthew 18:10 (id: 940018010)

10See that you would not despise one of these little ones. For I say to you that in heaven their angels always look on the face of my Father in the heavens.


## Matthew 18:11 (id: 940018011)

11\[For the Son of Man came to save the one that has been lost.]


## Matthew 18:12 (id: 940018012)

12What do you think? If a certain man has 100 sheep, and one of them goes astray, having left the 99 on the mountains and having gone, does he not seek the one having gone astray?


## Matthew 18:13 (id: 940018013)

13And if he happens to find it, truly I say to you that he rejoices over it more than over the 99 that have not gone astray.


## Matthew 18:14 (id: 940018014)

14In the same way, it is not the will before your Father in the heavens that one of these little ones would perish.


## Matthew 18:15 (id: 940018015)

15But if your brother sins against you, go, reprove him between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother.


## Matthew 18:16 (id: 940018016)

16But if he does not listen, take with you yet one or two {others}, so that ‘by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word might be verified.’


## Matthew 18:17 (id: 940018017)

17But if he refuses to listen to them, speak to the church. But if he also refuses to listen to the church, let him be to you even as the Gentile and the tax collector.


## Matthew 18:18 (id: 940018018)

18Truly I say to you, whatever you bind on the earth will be bound in heaven; and whatever you release on the earth will be released in heaven.


## Matthew 18:19 (id: 940018019)

19Again, truly I say to you that if two of you agree together on the earth about any matter, whatever they might ask, it will be done for them by my Father in the heavens.


## Matthew 18:20 (id: 940018020)

20For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there I am in their midst.”


## Matthew 18:21 (id: 940018021)

21Then having approached, Peter said to him, “Lord, how often will my brother sin against me and I will forgive him? Until seven times?”


## Matthew 18:22 (id: 940018022)

22Jesus says to him, “I do not say to you up to seven times, but up to 77 times.


## Matthew 18:23 (id: 940018023)

23For this reason, the kingdom of the heavens is compared to a man, a king, who wanted to take up a word together with his slaves.


## Matthew 18:24 (id: 940018024)

24Now {when} he had begun to take up together, one debtor of 10,000 talents was brought to him.


## Matthew 18:25 (id: 940018025)

25But, he not being able to repay, the master commanded him to be sold, together with his wife and children and everything, as much as he had, and repayment to be made.


## Matthew 18:26 (id: 940018026)

26So, having fallen down, the slave was bowing down before him, saying, ‘Master, have patience with me, and I will repay you everything.’


## Matthew 18:27 (id: 940018027)

27Now having had compassion, the master of that slave released him and forgave him the debt.


## Matthew 18:28 (id: 940018028)

28But having gone out, that slave found one of his fellow slaves, who owed him 100 denarii, and having seized him, he choked {him}, saying, ‘Repay whatever you owe.’


## Matthew 18:29 (id: 940018029)

29So, having fallen down, his fellow slave begged him, saying, ‘Have patience with me, and I will repay you.’


## Matthew 18:30 (id: 940018030)

30But he was not willing. Instead, having gone away, he threw him into prison until he might repay {what} is owed.


## Matthew 18:31 (id: 940018031)

31Therefore, his fellow slaves, having seen {what} had happened, were very grieved. And having come, they explained to their master everything that had happened.


## Matthew 18:32 (id: 940018032)

32Then, having summoned him, his master says to him, ‘Wicked slave, I forgave you all that debt because you begged me.


## Matthew 18:33 (id: 940018033)

33Was it not necessary for you also to have had mercy on your fellow slave, just as I also had mercy on you?’


## Matthew 18:34 (id: 940018034)

34And having become angry, his master handed him over to the torturers until he would repay all that is owed.


## Matthew 18:35 (id: 940018035)

35Thus also my heavenly Father will do to you, if each of you does not forgive his brother out of your hearts.”


## Matthew 19:1 (id: 940019001)

1And it happened that when Jesus had finished these words, he departed from Galilee and came to the regions of Judea beyond the Jordan.


## Matthew 19:2 (id: 940019002)

2And great crowds followed him, and he healed them there.


## Matthew 19:3 (id: 940019003)

3And Pharisees approached him, testing him, and saying whether it is lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason.


## Matthew 19:4 (id: 940019004)

4But he, answering, said, “Have you not read that the one having made {them} from the beginning ‘made them male and female,’


## Matthew 19:5 (id: 940019005)

5and said, ‘Because of this, a man will leave his father and mother and will be joined to his wife, and the two will be one flesh’?


## Matthew 19:6 (id: 940019006)

6So then, they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God joined together, let man not separate.”


## Matthew 19:7 (id: 940019007)

7They say to him, “Why then did Moses command {us} to give a certificate of divorce and to divorce her?”


## Matthew 19:8 (id: 940019008)

8He says to them, “Because of your hardness of heart, Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not that way.


## Matthew 19:9 (id: 940019009)

9But I say to you that whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery; and the one having married one that has been divorced commits adultery.”


## Matthew 19:10 (id: 940019010)

10The disciples say to him, “If thus is the reason of the man with his wife, it is better not to marry.”


## Matthew 19:11 (id: 940019011)

11But he said to them, “Not all receive this word, but to whom it has been given.


## Matthew 19:12 (id: 940019012)

12For there are eunuchs who were born thus from their mother’s womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs because of the kingdom of the heavens. The one being able to receive {this}, let him receive {it}.”


## Matthew 19:13 (id: 940019013)

13Then little children were brought to him so that he would lay his hands on them and would pray, but the disciples rebuked them.


## Matthew 19:14 (id: 940019014)

14But Jesus said, “Permit the little children, and do not forbid them to come to me, for of the ones such as these is the kingdom of the heavens.”


## Matthew 19:15 (id: 940019015)

15And having laid his hands on them, he went from there.


## Matthew 19:16 (id: 940019016)

16And behold, one, having approached him, said, “Teacher, what good thing should I do in order that I might have eternal life?”


## Matthew 19:17 (id: 940019017)

17But he said to him, “Why do you ask me about {what is} good? One is good, but if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.”


## Matthew 19:18 (id: 940019018)

18He says to him, “Which ones?” And Jesus said, “Do not kill, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not testify falsely,


## Matthew 19:19 (id: 940019019)

19honor your father and your mother, and love your neighbor as yourself.”


## Matthew 19:20 (id: 940019020)

20The young man says to him, “All these things I have kept. What do I still lack?”


## Matthew 19:21 (id: 940019021)

21Jesus said to him, “If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in the heavens; and come, follow me.”


## Matthew 19:22 (id: 940019022)

22But the young man, having heard the word, went away being grieved, for he was having many possessions.


## Matthew 19:23 (id: 940019023)

23Now Jesus said to his disciples, “Truly I say to you, a rich {person} will enter difficultly into the kingdom of the heavens.


## Matthew 19:24 (id: 940019024)

24And again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to pass through an eye of a needle than for a rich {person} to enter into the kingdom of God.”


## Matthew 19:25 (id: 940019025)

25Now having heard this, the disciples were very astonished, saying, “Who then is able to be saved?”


## Matthew 19:26 (id: 940019026)

26But Jesus, having looked at {them}, said to them, “With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”


## Matthew 19:27 (id: 940019027)

27Then answering, Peter said to him, “Behold, we left everything and followed you. What then will there be for us?”


## Matthew 19:28 (id: 940019028)

28And Jesus said to them, “Truly I say to you that in the renewal when the Son of Man sits on his throne of glory, you, the ones having followed me, you also will sit upon 12 thrones, judging the 12 tribes of Israel.


## Matthew 19:29 (id: 940019029)

29And everyone who has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or a father, or a mother, or a wife, or children, or lands for the sake of my name, will receive 100 times {as much} and will inherit eternal life.


## Matthew 19:30 (id: 940019030)

30But many first will be last, and last, first.


## Matthew 20:1 (id: 940020001)

1For the kingdom of the heavens is like a man, the master of the house, who went out with the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.


## Matthew 20:2 (id: 940020002)

2Now having agreed with the workers for a denarius for the day, he sent them into his vineyard.


## Matthew 20:3 (id: 940020003)

3And having gone out about the third hour, he saw others standing idle in the marketplace.


## Matthew 20:4 (id: 940020004)

4And to them he said, ‘You also, go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you.’


## Matthew 20:5 (id: 940020005)

5So they went out. Having gone out again about the sixth and ninth hour, he did likewise.


## Matthew 20:6 (id: 940020006)

6Now having gone out about the eleventh {hour}, he found others standing, and he says to them, ‘Why have you stood here idle the whole day?’


## Matthew 20:7 (id: 940020007)

7They say to him, ‘Because no one hired us.’ He says to them, ‘You also go into the vineyard.’


## Matthew 20:8 (id: 940020008)

8And evening having come, the owner of the vineyard says to his manager, ‘Call the workers and pay them their wages, having begun from the last to the first.’


## Matthew 20:9 (id: 940020009)

9And having come, the ones about the eleventh hour each received a denarius.


## Matthew 20:10 (id: 940020010)

10But having come, the first thought that they will receive more, but they also received a denarius each.


## Matthew 20:11 (id: 940020011)

11But having received {it}, they were murmuring against the master of the house,


## Matthew 20:12 (id: 940020012)

12saying, ‘These last ones have done one hour, but you made them equal to us, the ones having borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat.’


## Matthew 20:13 (id: 940020013)

13But he, answering, said to one of them, ‘Friend, I am not wronging you. Did you not agree with me for a denarius?


## Matthew 20:14 (id: 940020014)

14Take {what is} yours and go away. But I desire to give to this last as also to you.


## Matthew 20:15 (id: 940020015)

15Or is it not lawful for me to do what I desire with {what is} mine? Or is your eye evil because I am good?’


## Matthew 20:16 (id: 940020016)

16In the same way, the last will be first, and the first last.”


## Matthew 20:17 (id: 940020017)

17And Jesus, going up to Jerusalem, took the 12 disciples aside by themselves, and on the way he said to them,


## Matthew 20:18 (id: 940020018)

18“Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death


## Matthew 20:19 (id: 940020019)

19and hand him over to the Gentiles for them to mock and to whip and to crucify him. But on the third day he will be raised up.”


## Matthew 20:20 (id: 940020020)

20Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee approached him with her sons, bowing down and asking for something from him.


## Matthew 20:21 (id: 940020021)

21And he said to her, “What do you desire?” She says to him, “Say that these two sons of mine might sit, one at your right hand and one at your left hand, in your kingdom.”


## Matthew 20:22 (id: 940020022)

22But answering, Jesus said, “You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink?” They say to him, “We are able.”


## Matthew 20:23 (id: 940020023)

23He says to them, “My cup you will drink. But to sit at my right hand and at my left hand is not mine to give, but for whom it has been prepared by my Father.”


## Matthew 20:24 (id: 940020024)

24And having heard this, the ten were very angry with the two brothers.


## Matthew 20:25 (id: 940020025)

25But Jesus, having summoned them, said, “You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and the great ones exercise authority over them.


## Matthew 20:26 (id: 940020026)

26It is not this way among you. Instead, whoever desires to become great among you will be your servant,


## Matthew 20:27 (id: 940020027)

27and whoever desires to be first among you will be your slave,


## Matthew 20:28 (id: 940020028)

28just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom in exchange for many.”


## Matthew 20:29 (id: 940020029)

29And {as} they were going out from Jericho, a great crowd followed him.


## Matthew 20:30 (id: 940020030)

30And behold, two blind men, sitting beside the road, having heard that Jesus is passing by, cried out, saying, “Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David.”


## Matthew 20:31 (id: 940020031)

31Now the crowd rebuked them, so that they would be silent, but they cried out even more, saying, “Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David.”


## Matthew 20:32 (id: 940020032)

32And having stood still, Jesus called them and said, “What do you desire {that} I might do for you?”


## Matthew 20:33 (id: 940020033)

33They say to him, “Lord, that our eyes might be opened.”


## Matthew 20:34 (id: 940020034)

34Now having had compassion, Jesus touched their eyes. And immediately they saw again, and they followed him.


## Matthew 21:1 (id: 940021001)

1And when they came near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage, to the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,


## Matthew 21:2 (id: 940021002)

2saying to them, “Go into the village opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied up, and a colt with her. Having untied {them}, bring {them} to me.


## Matthew 21:3 (id: 940021003)

3And if anyone says anything to you, you will say, ‘The Lord has need of them,’ and immediately he will send them.”


## Matthew 21:4 (id: 940021004)

4Now this happened so that {what} was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying,


## Matthew 21:5 (id: 940021005)

5“Tell the daughter of Zion, ‘Behold, your King is coming to you, humble and riding on a donkey, and on a colt, a son of a beast of burden.’”


## Matthew 21:6 (id: 940021006)

6Now the disciples, having gone and having done just as Jesus had directed them,


## Matthew 21:7 (id: 940021007)

7brought the donkey and the colt and put their cloaks on them, and he sat upon them.


## Matthew 21:8 (id: 940021008)

8Now the largest crowd spread their cloaks on the road, and others were cutting branches from the trees and were spreading {them} on the road.


## Matthew 21:9 (id: 940021009)

9Now the crowds going before him and following were crying out, saying, “Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is the one coming in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!”


## Matthew 21:10 (id: 940021010)

10And {when} he had entered into Jerusalem, the whole city was shaken, saying, “Who is this?”


## Matthew 21:11 (id: 940021011)

11And the crowds were saying, “This is Jesus the prophet from Nazareth of Galilee.”


## Matthew 21:12 (id: 940021012)

12And Jesus entered into the temple and cast out all the ones selling and buying in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of the ones selling the doves.


## Matthew 21:13 (id: 940021013)

13And he says to them, “It has been written, ‘My house will be called a house of prayer,’ but you make it a ‘den of robbers.’”


## Matthew 21:14 (id: 940021014)

14And the blind and the lame approached him in the temple, and he healed them.


## Matthew 21:15 (id: 940021015)

15But the chief priests and the scribes, having seen the marvelous things that he did, and the children crying out in the temple and saying, “Hosanna to the Son of David,” became very angry.


## Matthew 21:16 (id: 940021016)

16And they said to him, “Do you hear what these are saying?” But Jesus says to them, “Yes! Have you never read,


## Matthew 21:17 (id: 940021017)

17And having left them, he went out from the city to Bethany and spent the night there.


## Matthew 21:18 (id: 940021018)

18Now in the morning, returning to the city, he was hungry.


## Matthew 21:19 (id: 940021019)

19And having seen one fig tree along the road, he went to it and found nothing on it except leaves only. And he says to it, “May there no longer be fruit from you to eternity,” and immediately the fig tree withered.


## Matthew 21:20 (id: 940021020)

20And having seen this, the disciples marveled, saying, “How did the fig tree immediately wither?”


## Matthew 21:21 (id: 940021021)

21But answering, Jesus said to them, “Truly I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do {what was} of the fig tree, but also if you say to this mountain, ‘Be taken up and be thrown into the sea,’ it will happen.


## Matthew 21:22 (id: 940021022)

22And everything, as much as you request in prayer, believing, you will receive.”


## Matthew 21:23 (id: 940021023)

23And {when} he had come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people approached him teaching, saying, “By what authority do you do these things, and who gave you this authority?”


## Matthew 21:24 (id: 940021024)

24But answering, Jesus said to them, “I also will ask you one word, which if you tell me, I also will tell you by what authority I do these things.


## Matthew 21:25 (id: 940021025)

25The baptism of John—from where was it? From heaven or from men?” But they were reasoning among themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say to us, ‘For what {reason} then did you not believe him?’


## Matthew 21:26 (id: 940021026)

26But if we say, ‘From men,’ we fear the crowd, for they all regard John as a prophet.”


## Matthew 21:27 (id: 940021027)

27And answering Jesus, they said, “We do not know.” He also said to them, “Nor do I tell you by what authority I do these things.


## Matthew 21:28 (id: 940021028)

28But what do you think? A man had two children, and having approached the first, he said, ‘Child, go, work today in the vineyard.’


## Matthew 21:29 (id: 940021029)

29But he, answering, said, ‘I will not,’ but afterward, having changed his mind, he went.


## Matthew 21:30 (id: 940021030)

30But having approached the other, he said likewise. And he, answering, said, ‘I will, lord,’ but he did not go.


## Matthew 21:31 (id: 940021031)

31Which of the two did the will of his father?” They say, “The first.” Jesus says to them, “Truly I say to you that the tax collectors and the prostitutes enter into the kingdom of God before you.


## Matthew 21:32 (id: 940021032)

32For John came to you in the way of righteousness, but you did not believe him. But the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. But you, having seen this, did not change your minds afterward to believe in him.


## Matthew 21:33 (id: 940021033)

33Listen to another parable. There was a man, a master of a house, who planted a vineyard and put a hedge around it and dug a winepress in it and built a watchtower and rented it out to farmers and went abroad.


## Matthew 21:34 (id: 940021034)

34Now when the time of the fruits came near, he sent his servants to the farmers to receive his fruits.


## Matthew 21:35 (id: 940021035)

35But the farmers, having seized his servants, beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.


## Matthew 21:36 (id: 940021036)

36Again, he sent other servants, more than the first, but they did to them likewise.


## Matthew 21:37 (id: 940021037)

37But afterward, he sent to them his son, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’


## Matthew 21:38 (id: 940021038)

38But the farmers, having seen the son, said among themselves, ‘This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and have his inheritance.’


## Matthew 21:39 (id: 940021039)

39And having seized him, they threw him out of the vineyard and killed {him}.


## Matthew 21:40 (id: 940021040)

40Therefore, when the lord of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those farmers?”


## Matthew 21:41 (id: 940021041)

41They say to him, “He will severely destroy those evil ones, and he will rent out the vineyard to other farmers who will repay him the fruits in their times.”


## Matthew 21:42 (id: 940021042)

42Jesus says to them, “Did you never read in the Scriptures, ‘A stone that the builders rejected, this has become the head of the corner. This came about from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes’?


## Matthew 21:43 (id: 940021043)

43For this reason I say to you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and will be given to a nation producing its fruits.


## Matthew 21:44 (id: 940021044)

44And the one having fallen on this stone will be broken to pieces, but on whomever it falls, it will crush him.”


## Matthew 21:45 (id: 940021045)

45And the chief priests and the Pharisees, having heard his parables, knew that he is speaking about them.


## Matthew 21:46 (id: 940021046)

46And seeking to seize him, they feared the crowds, because they were regarding him as a prophet.


## Matthew 22:1 (id: 940022001)

1And answering, Jesus again spoke to them in parables, saying,


## Matthew 22:2 (id: 940022002)

2“The kingdom of the heavens is compared to a man, a king, who made a wedding feast for his son.


## Matthew 22:3 (id: 940022003)

3And he sent out his servants to call the ones having been invited to the wedding feast, and they were not willing to come.


## Matthew 22:4 (id: 940022004)

4Again he sent other servants, saying, ‘Say to the ones having been invited, “Behold, I have prepared my dinner. My bulls and fattened calves have been killed, and all things are ready. Come to the wedding feast.”’


## Matthew 22:5 (id: 940022005)

5But they, having paid no attention, went away, one to his own field and one to his business.


## Matthew 22:6 (id: 940022006)

6But the rest, having seized his servants, mistreated and killed {them}.


## Matthew 22:7 (id: 940022007)

7But the king became angry, and having sent his soldiers, he destroyed those murderers and burned their city.


## Matthew 22:8 (id: 940022008)

8Then he says to his servants, ‘The wedding feast is ready, but the ones having been invited were not worthy.


## Matthew 22:9 (id: 940022009)

9Therefore, go to the crossings of the roads and invite as many as you find to the wedding feast.’


## Matthew 22:10 (id: 940022010)

10And those servants, having gone out to the roads, gathered together all whom they found, both evil and good, and the wedding was filled {with those} reclining to eat.


## Matthew 22:11 (id: 940022011)

11But the king, having come in to look at the ones reclining to eat, saw there a man not wearing wedding clothes.


## Matthew 22:12 (id: 940022012)

12And he says to him, ‘Friend, how did you come in here, not having wedding clothes?’ But he was silent.


## Matthew 22:13 (id: 940022013)

13Then the king said to the servants, ‘Having bound his feet and hands, throw him out into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and grinding of the teeth.’


## Matthew 22:14 (id: 940022014)

14For many are called, but few chosen.”


## Matthew 22:15 (id: 940022015)

15Then having gone, the Pharisees took counsel how they might entrap him in word.


## Matthew 22:16 (id: 940022016)

16And they send to him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that you are truthful, and you teach the way of God in truth, and it is not a concern to you about anyone, for you do not look at the face of men.


## Matthew 22:17 (id: 940022017)

17Therefore, tell us, what do you think? Is it lawful to give a poll tax to Caesar, or not?”


## Matthew 22:18 (id: 940022018)

18But Jesus, having known their wickedness, said, “Why are you testing me, hypocrites?


## Matthew 22:19 (id: 940022019)

19Show me the coin of the poll tax.” And they brought a denarius to him.


## Matthew 22:20 (id: 940022020)

20And he says to them, “Whose image and inscription {is} this?”


## Matthew 22:21 (id: 940022021)

21They say, “Caesar’s.” Then he says to them, “Therefore, give back the things of Caesar to Caesar, and the things of God to God.”


## Matthew 22:22 (id: 940022022)

22And having heard {it}, they marveled, and having left him, they went away.


## Matthew 22:23 (id: 940022023)

23On that day Sadducees, saying there is no resurrection, approached him and questioned him,


## Matthew 22:24 (id: 940022024)

24saying, “Teacher, Moses said, ‘If someone dies, not having children, his brother will marry his wife and will raise up seed for his brother.’


## Matthew 22:25 (id: 940022025)

25But there were among us seven brothers, and the first, having married, died. And not having seed, he left his wife to his brother.


## Matthew 22:26 (id: 940022026)

26Likewise also, the second and the third, until the seven.


## Matthew 22:27 (id: 940022027)

27And last of all, the woman died.


## Matthew 22:28 (id: 940022028)

28Therefore, in the resurrection, of which of the seven will she be a wife? For they all had her.”


## Matthew 22:29 (id: 940022029)

29But answering, Jesus said to them, “You are being led astray, not knowing the Scriptures or the power of God.


## Matthew 22:30 (id: 940022030)

30For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but they are like angels in heaven.


## Matthew 22:31 (id: 940022031)

31But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read {what} was spoken to you by God, saying,


## Matthew 22:32 (id: 940022032)

32‘I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’? He is not a God of the dead, but of the living.”


## Matthew 22:33 (id: 940022033)

33And having heard this, the crowds were astonished at his teaching.


## Matthew 22:34 (id: 940022034)

34But the Pharisees, having heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, gathered together at the same place.


## Matthew 22:35 (id: 940022035)

35And one of them, a lawyer, questioned {him}, testing him—


## Matthew 22:36 (id: 940022036)

36“Teacher, which {is} the great commandment in the law?”


## Matthew 22:37 (id: 940022037)

37But he said to him, “‘You will love the Lord your God with your whole heart, and with your whole soul, and with your whole mind.’


## Matthew 22:38 (id: 940022038)

38This is the great and first commandment.


## Matthew 22:39 (id: 940022039)

39Now a second {is} like it—‘You will love your neighbor as yourself.’


## Matthew 22:40 (id: 940022040)

40On these two commandments are hung the whole Law and the Prophets.”


## Matthew 22:41 (id: 940022041)

41Now the Pharisees having been gathered together, Jesus questioned them,


## Matthew 22:42 (id: 940022042)

42saying, “What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?” They say to him, “David’s.”


## Matthew 22:43 (id: 940022043)

43He says to them, “How then does David in the Spirit call him ‘Lord,’ saying,


## Matthew 22:44 (id: 940022044)

44‘The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at my right hand, until I put your enemies under your feet”’?


## Matthew 22:45 (id: 940022045)

45If David therefore calls him ‘Lord,’ how is he his son?”


## Matthew 22:46 (id: 940022046)

46And no one was able to answer him a word, nor did anyone dare from that day to question him any longer.


## Matthew 23:1 (id: 940023001)

1Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples,


## Matthew 23:2 (id: 940023002)

2saying, “The scribes and the Pharisees sat in the seat of Moses.


## Matthew 23:3 (id: 940023003)

3Therefore, everything, as much as they say to you, do and keep. But do not do according to their works, for they say and do not do.


## Matthew 23:4 (id: 940023004)

4And they tie up loads, heavy and difficult to carry, and they put {them} on the shoulders of men, but they themselves are not willing with their finger to move them.


## Matthew 23:5 (id: 940023005)

5But they do all their deeds to be seen by men. For they broaden their phylacteries and they lengthen their tassels.


## Matthew 23:6 (id: 940023006)

6And they love the first places at the banquets and the first seats in the synagogues,


## Matthew 23:7 (id: 940023007)

7and the greetings in the marketplaces, and to be called ‘Rabbi’ by men.


## Matthew 23:8 (id: 940023008)

8But you should not be called ‘Rabbi,’ for one is your teacher, and you are all brothers.


## Matthew 23:9 (id: 940023009)

9And you should not call {anyone} on the earth your father, for one is your heavenly Father.


## Matthew 23:10 (id: 940023010)

10And you should not be called ‘teacher,’ for your teacher is one, the Christ.


## Matthew 23:11 (id: 940023011)

11But the greatest among you will be your servant.


## Matthew 23:12 (id: 940023012)

12But whoever will exalt himself will be humbled, and whoever will humble himself will be exalted.


## Matthew 23:13 (id: 940023013)

13But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut the kingdom of the heavens in front of men. For you do not enter in, nor do you permit the ones entering to enter.


## Matthew 23:14 (id: 940023014)

14\[But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you devour the houses of widows, also for a pretext praying at length. For this reason, you will receive greater judgment.]


## Matthew 23:15 (id: 940023015)

15Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you go around the sea and the dry land to make one proselyte, and when he becomes {one}, you make him twice as much a son of Gehenna as you.


## Matthew 23:16 (id: 940023016)

16Woe to you, blind guides, the ones saying, ‘Whoever swears by the temple, it is nothing. But whoever swears by the gold of the temple, he is obligated.’


## Matthew 23:17 (id: 940023017)

17Foolish and blind! For which is greater, the gold or the temple having sanctified the gold?


## Matthew 23:18 (id: 940023018)

18And, ‘Whoever swears by the altar, it is nothing. But whoever swears by the gift on top of it, he is obligated.’


## Matthew 23:19 (id: 940023019)

19Foolish and blind! For which {is} greater, the gift or the altar sanctifying the gift?


## Matthew 23:20 (id: 940023020)

20Therefore, the one having sworn by the altar swears by it and by everything {that is} on top of it.


## Matthew 23:21 (id: 940023021)

21And the one having sworn by the temple swears by it and by the one inhabiting it.


## Matthew 23:22 (id: 940023022)

22And the one having sworn by heaven swears by the throne of God and by the one sitting on it.


## Matthew 23:23 (id: 940023023)

23Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe the mint and the dill and the cumin, but you have neglected the weightier {things} of the law—justice and mercy and faith. But it was necessary to do these and those not to neglect.


## Matthew 23:24 (id: 940023024)

24Blind guides, the ones straining out the gnat but swallowing the camel!


## Matthew 23:25 (id: 940023025)

25Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and of the plate, but inside they are full of greed and lack of self\-control.


## Matthew 23:26 (id: 940023026)

26Blind Pharisee! Clean first the inside of the cup and of the plate, so that the outside of them might become clean also.


## Matthew 23:27 (id: 940023027)

27Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which on the outside appear beautiful, but on the inside are full of bones of the dead and all uncleanness.


## Matthew 23:28 (id: 940023028)

28In the same way, you also on the outside appear righteous to men, but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.


## Matthew 23:29 (id: 940023029)

29Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the tombs of the righteous.


## Matthew 23:30 (id: 940023030)

30And you say, ‘If we were in the days of our fathers, we would not have been sharers with them in the blood of the prophets.’


## Matthew 23:31 (id: 940023031)

31Therefore you testify against yourselves that you are sons of the ones having killed the prophets.


## Matthew 23:32 (id: 940023032)

32And you, fill up the measure of your fathers!


## Matthew 23:33 (id: 940023033)

33Serpents, offspring of vipers, how might you escape from the judgment of Gehenna?


## Matthew 23:34 (id: 940023034)

34For this reason, behold, I am sending to you prophets and wise {ones} and scribes. From them you will kill and crucify, and from them you will whip in your synagogues and pursue from city to city,


## Matthew 23:35 (id: 940023035)

35so that might come upon you all the righteous blood being shed on the earth, from the blood of Abel the righteous to the blood of Zechariah son of Barachiah, whom you killed between the temple and the altar.


## Matthew 23:36 (id: 940023036)

36Truly I say to you, all these things will come upon this generation.


## Matthew 23:37 (id: 940023037)

37Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the one killing the prophets and stoning the ones having been sent to her! How often I desired to gather your children the way a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were not willing!


## Matthew 23:38 (id: 940023038)

38Behold, your house is left to you desolate.


## Matthew 23:39 (id: 940023039)

39For I say to you, you will certainly not see me from now until you say, ‘Blessed is the one coming in the name of the Lord!’”


## Matthew 24:1 (id: 940024001)

1And Jesus, having gone out from the temple, was going away. And his disciples approached {him} to show him the buildings of the temple.


## Matthew 24:2 (id: 940024002)

2But he, answering, said to them, “Do you not see all these things? Truly I say to you, a stone upon a stone will certainly not be left here, which will not be torn down.”


## Matthew 24:3 (id: 940024003)

3Now {as} he was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples approached him by themselves, saying, “Tell us, when will these things be? And what {is} the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?”


## Matthew 24:4 (id: 940024004)

4And answering, Jesus said to them, “Be careful that no one leads you astray.


## Matthew 24:5 (id: 940024005)

5For many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am the Christ,’ and they will lead many astray.


## Matthew 24:6 (id: 940024006)

6And you are going to hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not troubled, for it is necessary {for this} to happen, but the end is not yet.


## Matthew 24:7 (id: 940024007)

7For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places.


## Matthew 24:8 (id: 940024008)

8But all these things {are} the beginning of birth pains.


## Matthew 24:9 (id: 940024009)

9Then they will hand you over to tribulation and will kill you, and you will be hated by all the nations because of my name.


## Matthew 24:10 (id: 940024010)

10And then many will be caused to stumble and will hand one another over and will hate one another.


## Matthew 24:11 (id: 940024011)

11And many false prophets will be raised up and will lead many astray.


## Matthew 24:12 (id: 940024012)

12And because lawlessness will be increased, the love of many will grow cold.


## Matthew 24:13 (id: 940024013)

13But the one having endured to the end, this one will be saved.


## Matthew 24:14 (id: 940024014)

14And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world for a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come.


## Matthew 24:15 (id: 940024015)

15Therefore, when you see the abomination of desolation having been spoken of by Daniel the prophet standing in the holy place” (let the one reading understand),


## Matthew 24:16 (id: 940024016)

16“then let the ones in Judea flee to the mountains,


## Matthew 24:17 (id: 940024017)

17let the one on the housetop not go down to take anything from his house,


## Matthew 24:18 (id: 940024018)

18and let the one in the field not turn back to take his cloak.


## Matthew 24:19 (id: 940024019)

19But woe to the ones having in the womb and to the ones nursing in those days!


## Matthew 24:20 (id: 940024020)

20But pray that your flight might not happen in winter nor on a Sabbath.


## Matthew 24:21 (id: 940024021)

21For then will be great tribulation, such as has not happened from the beginning of the world until now, nor will ever happen.


## Matthew 24:22 (id: 940024022)

22And if those days had not been shortened, no flesh would be saved. But because of the elect, those days will be shortened.


## Matthew 24:23 (id: 940024023)

23Then if anyone says to you, ‘Behold, here {is} the Christ!’ or, ‘Here!’ you should not believe {it}.


## Matthew 24:24 (id: 940024024)

24For false Christs and false prophets will be raised up and will give great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect.


## Matthew 24:25 (id: 940024025)

25Behold, I have told you beforehand.


## Matthew 24:26 (id: 940024026)

26Therefore, if they say to you, ‘Behold, he is in the wilderness,’ you should not go out; ‘Behold, in the inner chambers,’ you should not believe {it}.


## Matthew 24:27 (id: 940024027)

27For just as the lightning comes out from the east and shines as far as the west, thus will be the coming of the Son of Man.


## Matthew 24:28 (id: 940024028)

28Wherever the corpse is, there the vultures will be gathered.


## Matthew 24:29 (id: 940024029)

29But immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.


## Matthew 24:30 (id: 940024030)

30And then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn. And they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and much glory.


## Matthew 24:31 (id: 940024031)

31And he will send his angels with a great trumpet, and they will gather together his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the heavens to the ends of them.


## Matthew 24:32 (id: 940024032)

32Now learn the parable from the fig tree: When its branch already becomes tender and it puts out leaves, you know that the summer {is} near.


## Matthew 24:33 (id: 940024033)

33Thus also you, when you see all these things, know that it is near, at the doors.


## Matthew 24:34 (id: 940024034)

34Truly I say to you that this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things happen.


## Matthew 24:35 (id: 940024035)

35The heaven and the earth will pass away, but my words will certainly not pass away.


## Matthew 24:36 (id: 940024036)

36But concerning that day and hour no one knows, neither the angels of the heavens, nor the Son, except the Father only.


## Matthew 24:37 (id: 940024037)

37For just as the days of Noah, thus will be the coming of the Son of Man.


## Matthew 24:38 (id: 940024038)

38For as in the days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until that day Noah entered into the ark,


## Matthew 24:39 (id: 940024039)

39and they did not know until the flood came and took {them} all away, thus also will be the coming of the Son of Man.


## Matthew 24:40 (id: 940024040)

40Then two will be in the field—one is taken, and one is left.


## Matthew 24:41 (id: 940024041)

41Two grinding with the mill—one is taken, and one is left.


## Matthew 24:42 (id: 940024042)

42Therefore, be alert, for you do not know on what day your Lord will come.


## Matthew 24:43 (id: 940024043)

43But know this, that if the master of the house had known in which watch the thief comes, he would have been alert and would not have allowed his house to be broken into.


## Matthew 24:44 (id: 940024044)

44For this reason you also be ready, because in that hour you do not think, the Son of Man comes.


## Matthew 24:45 (id: 940024045)

45Who then is the faithful and wise slave whom the master has appointed over his household to give them their food in time?


## Matthew 24:46 (id: 940024046)

46Blessed {is} that slave whom his master, having come, will find doing thus.


## Matthew 24:47 (id: 940024047)

47Truly I say to you that he will appoint him over all his possessions.


## Matthew 24:48 (id: 940024048)

48But if that evil slave says in his heart, ‘My master delays,’


## Matthew 24:49 (id: 940024049)

49and he begins to beat his fellow slaves and eats and drinks with the ones being drunk,


## Matthew 24:50 (id: 940024050)

50the master of that slave will come on a day that he does not expect and at an hour that he does not know,


## Matthew 24:51 (id: 940024051)

51and he will cut him in two and appoint his place with the hypocrites, where there will be weeping and grinding of the teeth.


## Matthew 25:1 (id: 940025001)

1Then the kingdom of the heavens will be compared to ten virgins who, having taken their lamps, went out to a meeting of the bridegroom.


## Matthew 25:2 (id: 940025002)

2Now five of them were foolish and five wise.


## Matthew 25:3 (id: 940025003)

3For the foolish, having taken their lamps, did not take oil with them.


## Matthew 25:4 (id: 940025004)

4But the wise took oil in the containers with their lamps.


## Matthew 25:5 (id: 940025005)

5But the bridegroom delaying, they all became sleepy and were sleeping.


## Matthew 25:6 (id: 940025006)

6But in the middle of the night there was a cry, ‘Behold, the bridegroom! Go out to the meeting.’


## Matthew 25:7 (id: 940025007)

7Then all those virgins got up and put their lamps in order.


## Matthew 25:8 (id: 940025008)

8Now the foolish said to the wise, ‘Give us from your oil, because our lamps are going out.’


## Matthew 25:9 (id: 940025009)

9But the wise answered, saying, ‘There will certainly not ever be enough for us and for you. Go instead to the ones selling and buy for yourselves.’


## Matthew 25:10 (id: 940025010)

10But, they going away to buy, the bridegroom came, and the prepared entered with him into the wedding feast, and the door was shut.


## Matthew 25:11 (id: 940025011)

11But afterward also the rest of the virgins come, saying, ‘Lord, lord, open for us!’


## Matthew 25:12 (id: 940025012)

12But he, answering, said, ‘Truly I say to you, I do not know you.’


## Matthew 25:13 (id: 940025013)

13Therefore, be alert, for you do not know the day nor the hour.


## Matthew 25:14 (id: 940025014)

14For {it is} as if a man, going abroad, called his own slaves and handed over to them his possessions.


## Matthew 25:15 (id: 940025015)

15And to one he gave five talents, and to one, two, and to one, one—to each according to his own ability. And immediately he went abroad.


## Matthew 25:16 (id: 940025016)

16Having gone, the one having received the five talents traded with them and gained another five talents.


## Matthew 25:17 (id: 940025017)

17Likewise, the one with the two also gained another two.


## Matthew 25:18 (id: 940025018)

18But the one having received the one, having gone away, dug in the ground and hid the money of his master.


## Matthew 25:19 (id: 940025019)

19Now after a long time, the master of those slaves comes and takes up a word together with them.


## Matthew 25:20 (id: 940025020)

20And having approached, the one having received the five talents brought another five talents, saying, ‘Master, you handed over to me five talents; behold, I gained another five talents.’


## Matthew 25:21 (id: 940025021)

21His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful slave! You were faithful over a few things. I will appoint you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master.’


## Matthew 25:22 (id: 940025022)

22Having approached, also the one with the two talents said, ‘Master, you handed over to me two talents; behold, I gained another two talents.’


## Matthew 25:23 (id: 940025023)

23His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful slave! You were faithful over a few things. I will appoint you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master.’


## Matthew 25:24 (id: 940025024)

24But having approached, also the one having received the one talent said, ‘Master, I knew you, that you are a harsh man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter.


## Matthew 25:25 (id: 940025025)

25And having become afraid, having gone away, I hid your talent in the ground. Behold, you have {what is} yours.’


## Matthew 25:26 (id: 940025026)

26But answering, his master said to him, ‘Wicked and lazy slave! Did you know that I reap where I did not sow and gather where I did not scatter?


## Matthew 25:27 (id: 940025027)

27Therefore, it was necessary for you to have put my money with the bankers, and having come, I would have received back {what is} mine with interest.


## Matthew 25:28 (id: 940025028)

28Therefore, take away the talent from him and give it to the one having the ten talents.


## Matthew 25:29 (id: 940025029)

29For to everyone having, it will be given and it will abound. But from the one not having, even what he has will be taken away from him.


## Matthew 25:30 (id: 940025030)

30And throw the worthless slave out into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and grinding of the teeth.’


## Matthew 25:31 (id: 940025031)

31Now when the Son of Man comes in his glory and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his throne of glory.


## Matthew 25:32 (id: 940025032)

32And before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate them from one another, just as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.


## Matthew 25:33 (id: 940025033)

33And he will place the sheep on his right, but the goats on his left.


## Matthew 25:34 (id: 940025034)

34Then the King will say to the ones on his right, ‘Come, the ones having been blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.


## Matthew 25:35 (id: 940025035)

35For I was hungry, and you gave me to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me to drink; I was a stranger, and you gathered together with me;


## Matthew 25:36 (id: 940025036)

36{I was} naked, and you clothed me; I was sick, and you cared for me; I was in prison, and you came to me.’


## Matthew 25:37 (id: 940025037)

37Then the righteous will answer him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you being hungry and feed {you}? Or being thirsty and give {you} to drink?


## Matthew 25:38 (id: 940025038)

38And when did we see you a stranger and gather together with {you}? Or naked and clothe {you}?


## Matthew 25:39 (id: 940025039)

39And when did we see you sick or in prison and come to you?’


## Matthew 25:40 (id: 940025040)

40And answering, the King will say to them, ‘Truly I say to you, as much as you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did for me.’


## Matthew 25:41 (id: 940025041)

41Then he will say also to the ones on his left, ‘Go from me, the ones having been cursed, into the eternal fire that has been prepared for the devil and his angels.


## Matthew 25:42 (id: 940025042)

42For I was hungry, and you did not give me to eat; I was thirsty, and you did not give me to drink;


## Matthew 25:43 (id: 940025043)

43I was a stranger, and you did not gather together with me; {I was} naked, and you did not clothe me; {I was} sick and in prison, and you did not care for me.’


## Matthew 25:44 (id: 940025044)

44Then they also will answer, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not serve you?’


## Matthew 25:45 (id: 940025045)

45Then he will answer them, saying, ‘Truly I say to you, as much as you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.’


## Matthew 25:46 (id: 940025046)

46And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.”


## Matthew 26:1 (id: 940026001)

1And it happened that when Jesus had finished all these words, he said to his disciples,


## Matthew 26:2 (id: 940026002)

2“You know that after two days the Passover happens, and the Son of Man is handed over to be crucified.”


## Matthew 26:3 (id: 940026003)

3Then the chief priests and the elders of the people were gathered together in the courtyard of the chief priest, the one called Caiaphas.


## Matthew 26:4 (id: 940026004)

4And they took counsel together in order that they might seize Jesus by deceit and kill him.


## Matthew 26:5 (id: 940026005)

5But they were saying, “Not during the festival, so that a riot does not happen among the people.”


## Matthew 26:6 (id: 940026006)

6Now, Jesus being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper,


## Matthew 26:7 (id: 940026007)

7a woman approached him having an alabaster jar of very expensive perfumed oil, and she poured {it} upon his head, {he} reclining to eat.


## Matthew 26:8 (id: 940026008)

8Now having seen this, the disciples became very angry, saying, “For what {is} this waste?


## Matthew 26:9 (id: 940026009)

9For this was able to be sold for much and given to the poor.”


## Matthew 26:10 (id: 940026010)

10But Jesus, knowing this, said to them, “Why are you causing trouble for the woman? For she did a good work for me.


## Matthew 26:11 (id: 940026011)

11For you always have the poor with you, but you do not always have me.


## Matthew 26:12 (id: 940026012)

12For she, putting this perfumed oil on my body, did {it} to prepare me for burial.


## Matthew 26:13 (id: 940026013)

13Truly I say to you, wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world, also what she did will be spoken in remembrance of her.”


## Matthew 26:14 (id: 940026014)

14Then one of the Twelve, the one called Judas Iscariot, having gone to the chief priests,


## Matthew 26:15 (id: 940026015)

15said, “What are you willing to give me, and I will hand him over to you?” And they weighed out 30 pieces of silver for him.


## Matthew 26:16 (id: 940026016)

16And from then he was seeking an opportunity in order that he might hand him over.


## Matthew 26:17 (id: 940026017)

17Now on the first of the Festival of Unleavened Bread the disciples approached Jesus, saying, “Where do you want {that} we might prepare for you to eat the Passover?”


## Matthew 26:18 (id: 940026018)

18And he said, “Go into the city to so\-and\-so and say to him, ‘The Teacher says, “My time is near. I with my disciples am doing the Passover with you.”’”


## Matthew 26:19 (id: 940026019)

19And the disciples did as Jesus directed them, and they prepared the Passover.


## Matthew 26:20 (id: 940026020)

20Now evening having come, he was reclining to eat with the Twelve.


## Matthew 26:21 (id: 940026021)

21And they eating, he said, “Truly I say to you that one of you will hand me over.”


## Matthew 26:22 (id: 940026022)

22And being very grieved, each one began to say to him, “Surely not I, Lord?”


## Matthew 26:23 (id: 940026023)

23But he, answering, said, “The one having dipped his hand with me in the bowl, this one will hand me over.


## Matthew 26:24 (id: 940026024)

24The Son of Man departs just as it has been written about him. But woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is handed over! It would have been good for him if that man had not been born.”


## Matthew 26:25 (id: 940026025)

25But answering, Judas, the one handing him over, said, “Surely not I, Rabbi?” He says to him, “You said {it}.”


## Matthew 26:26 (id: 940026026)

26Now they eating, Jesus, having taken bread and having blessed, broke {it}. And having given {it} to the disciples, he said, “Take, eat. This is my body.”


## Matthew 26:27 (id: 940026027)

27And having taken a cup and having given thanks, he gave {it} to them, saying, “Drink from it, all of you.


## Matthew 26:28 (id: 940026028)

28For this is my blood of the covenant that is being poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.


## Matthew 26:29 (id: 940026029)

29But I say to you, I will certainly not drink from now from this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of my Father.”


## Matthew 26:30 (id: 940026030)

30And having sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.


## Matthew 26:31 (id: 940026031)

31Then Jesus says to them, “You all will be caused to stumble on me in this night, for it is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’


## Matthew 26:32 (id: 940026032)

32But after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.”


## Matthew 26:33 (id: 940026033)

33But answering, Peter said to him, “If all will be caused to stumble on you, I never will be caused to stumble.”


## Matthew 26:34 (id: 940026034)

34Jesus said to him, “Truly I say to you that in this night, before a rooster crows, you will deny me three times.”


## Matthew 26:35 (id: 940026035)

35Peter says to him, “Even if it were necessary for me to die with you, I will certainly not deny you.” All the disciples also said likewise.


## Matthew 26:36 (id: 940026036)

36Then Jesus comes with them to a place called Gethsemane and says to the disciples, “Sit here while, having gone away there, I pray.”


## Matthew 26:37 (id: 940026037)

37And having taken along Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be grieved and greatly troubled.


## Matthew 26:38 (id: 940026038)

38Then he says to them, “My soul is very grieved, to death. Remain here and be alert with me.”


## Matthew 26:39 (id: 940026039)

39And having gone a little farther, he fell on his face, praying and saying, “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me. Yet, not as I will, but as you.”


## Matthew 26:40 (id: 940026040)

40And he comes to the disciples and finds them sleeping, and he says to Peter, “So, were you not able to be alert with me for one hour?


## Matthew 26:41 (id: 940026041)

41Be alert and pray so that you do not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed {is} willing, but the flesh {is} weak.”


## Matthew 26:42 (id: 940026042)

42Again, having gone away a second time, he prayed, saying, “My Father, if this is not able to pass away unless I drink it, let your will be done.”


## Matthew 26:43 (id: 940026043)

43And having come again, he found them sleeping, for their eyes were weighed down.


## Matthew 26:44 (id: 940026044)

44And having left them again, having gone away, he prayed a third time, having said the same word again.


## Matthew 26:45 (id: 940026045)

45Then he comes to the disciples and says to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour has come near, and the Son of Man is handed over into the hands of sinners.


## Matthew 26:46 (id: 940026046)

46Get up, let us go. Behold, the one handing me over has come near.”


## Matthew 26:47 (id: 940026047)

47And he still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the Twelve, came, and with him a large crowd with swords and clubs from the chief priests and elders of the people.


## Matthew 26:48 (id: 940026048)

48Now the one handing him over gave them a sign, saying, “Whomever I kiss is he. Seize him.”


## Matthew 26:49 (id: 940026049)

49And immediately, having approached Jesus, he said, “Rejoice, Rabbi!” and he kissed him.


## Matthew 26:50 (id: 940026050)

50But Jesus said to him, “Friend, for what are you present?” Then having approached, they laid hands on Jesus and seized him.


## Matthew 26:51 (id: 940026051)

51And behold, one of the ones with Jesus, having stretched out his hand, drew his sword, and having struck the servant of the high priest, cut off his ear.


## Matthew 26:52 (id: 940026052)

52Then Jesus says to him, “Return your sword to its place, for all the ones having taken a sword will perish by a sword.


## Matthew 26:53 (id: 940026053)

53Or do you think that I am not able to beg my Father, and he will provide me now with more than 12 legions of angels?


## Matthew 26:54 (id: 940026054)

54How then would the scriptures be fulfilled, that it is necessary to happen in this way?”


## Matthew 26:55 (id: 940026055)

55At that hour Jesus said to the crowds, “As against a robber have you come out with swords and clubs to seize me? Every day I was sitting in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me.


## Matthew 26:56 (id: 940026056)

56But all this has happened so that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled.” Then all the disciples, having left him, fled.


## Matthew 26:57 (id: 940026057)

57Now the ones having seized Jesus led {him} away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together.


## Matthew 26:58 (id: 940026058)

58But Peter was following him from a distance, as far as the courtyard of the high priest. And having entered inside, he was sitting down with the officers to see the end.


## Matthew 26:59 (id: 940026059)

59Now the chief priests and the entire Sanhedrin were seeking false testimony against Jesus so that they might put him to death.


## Matthew 26:60 (id: 940026060)

60And they did not find {any}, many false witnesses having approached. But later two, having approached,


## Matthew 26:61 (id: 940026061)

61said, “This one said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God and to rebuild {it} in three days.’”


## Matthew 26:62 (id: 940026062)

62And having stood up, the high priest said to him, “Do you answer nothing? What are these testifying against you?”


## Matthew 26:63 (id: 940026063)

63But Jesus was silent. And the high priest said to him, “I make you swear by the living God that you tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.”


## Matthew 26:64 (id: 940026064)

64Jesus says to him, “You said {it}. But I say to you, from now you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven.”


## Matthew 26:65 (id: 940026065)

65Then the high priest tore his robes, saying, “He has blasphemed! Why do we still have need of witnesses? Behold, now you have heard the blasphemy.


## Matthew 26:66 (id: 940026066)

66What do you think?” And they, answering, said, “He is deserving of death.”


## Matthew 26:67 (id: 940026067)

67Then they spit in his face and beat him. And they slapped him,


## Matthew 26:68 (id: 940026068)

68saying, “Prophesy to us, Christ. Who is the one having hit you?”


## Matthew 26:69 (id: 940026069)

69Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and one servant girl approached him, saying, “You also were with Jesus of Galilee.”


## Matthew 26:70 (id: 940026070)

70But he denied {it} before all, saying, “I do not know what you are saying.”


## Matthew 26:71 (id: 940026071)

71But {he} having gone out to the gateway, another saw him and says to the ones there, “This one was with Jesus the Nazarene.”


## Matthew 26:72 (id: 940026072)

72And again he denied {it} with an oath, “I do not know the man!”


## Matthew 26:73 (id: 940026073)

73But after a little {while} the ones standing {there}, having approached, said to Peter, “Truly you also are from them, for also your speech makes you evident.”


## Matthew 26:74 (id: 940026074)

74Then he began to curse and to swear, “I do not know the man!” And immediately a rooster crowed.


## Matthew 26:75 (id: 940026075)

75And Peter remembered the word of Jesus that he had said: “Before a rooster crows you will deny me three times.” And having gone outside, he wept bitterly.


## Matthew 27:1 (id: 940027001)

1Now morning having come, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus so as to put him to death.


## Matthew 27:2 (id: 940027002)

2And having bound him, they led {him} away and handed {him} over to Pilate the governor.


## Matthew 27:3 (id: 940027003)

3Then Judas, the one handing him over, having seen that he was condemned, having repented, returned the 30 pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,


## Matthew 27:4 (id: 940027004)

4saying, “I have sinned, having handed over innocent blood.” But they said, “What {is that} to us? You will see.”


## Matthew 27:5 (id: 940027005)

5And having thrown the pieces of silver into the temple, he withdrew. And having gone out, he hanged himself.


## Matthew 27:6 (id: 940027006)

6Now the chief priests, having taken the pieces of silver, said, “It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.”


## Matthew 27:7 (id: 940027007)

7But having taken counsel, they bought with them the field of the potter for burial for strangers.


## Matthew 27:8 (id: 940027008)

8Therefore, that field has been called Field of Blood to this day.


## Matthew 27:9 (id: 940027009)

9Then was fulfilled {what} was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “And they took the 30 pieces of silver, the price of the one having been priced, whom they from the sons of Israel priced,


## Matthew 27:10 (id: 940027010)

10and they gave them for the field of the potter, just as the Lord directed me.”


## Matthew 27:11 (id: 940027011)

11Now Jesus was stood before the governor, and the governor questioned him, saying, “Are you the King of the Jews?” But Jesus said to him, “You say {it}.”


## Matthew 27:12 (id: 940027012)

12And when he was accused by the chief priests and the elders, he answered nothing.


## Matthew 27:13 (id: 940027013)

13Then Pilate says to him, “Do you not hear how many things they are testifying against you?”


## Matthew 27:14 (id: 940027014)

14And he did not answer him, not even to one word, so as to amaze the governor very much.


## Matthew 27:15 (id: 940027015)

15Now at the festival the governor had been accustomed to release to the crowd one prisoner whom they were wishing.


## Matthew 27:16 (id: 940027016)

16Now at that time they were holding a well\-known prisoner named Barabbas.


## Matthew 27:17 (id: 940027017)

17Therefore, they being gathered together, Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want {that} I would release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus, the one called Christ?”


## Matthew 27:18 (id: 940027018)

18For he knew that they handed him over because of envy.


## Matthew 27:19 (id: 940027019)

19Now, he sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, “Nothing to you and to that righteous one, for I suffered many {things} today because of him by means of a dream.”


## Matthew 27:20 (id: 940027020)

20But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds so that they would ask for Barabbas but would destroy Jesus.


## Matthew 27:21 (id: 940027021)

21But answering, the governor said to them, “Whom from the two do you want {that} I would release to you?” But they said, “Barabbas.”


## Matthew 27:22 (id: 940027022)

22Pilate says to them, “What then should I do with Jesus, the one called Christ?” They all say, “Let him be crucified.”


## Matthew 27:23 (id: 940027023)

23But he said, “For what evil did he do?” But they were crying out even more, saying, “Let him be crucified.”


## Matthew 27:24 (id: 940027024)

24But Pilate, having seen that he is benefiting nothing, but instead a riot is happening, having taken water, washed his hands opposite the crowd, saying, “I am innocent from the blood of this one. You will see.”


## Matthew 27:25 (id: 940027025)

25And answering, all the people said, “His blood {be} on us and on our children!”


## Matthew 27:26 (id: 940027026)

26Then he released Barabbas to them, but having flogged Jesus, he handed {him} over so that he might be crucified.


## Matthew 27:27 (id: 940027027)

27Then the soldiers of the governor, having taken Jesus into the Praetorium, gathered together to him the whole cohort.


## Matthew 27:28 (id: 940027028)

28And having stripped him, they placed a scarlet cloak on him.


## Matthew 27:29 (id: 940027029)

29And having woven together a crown of thorns, they put {it} on his head and a reed in his right hand, and having knelt down before him, they mocked him, saying, “Rejoice, King of the Jews!”


## Matthew 27:30 (id: 940027030)

30And having spat on him, they took the reed and were striking {him} on his head.


## Matthew 27:31 (id: 940027031)

31And when they had mocked him, they took the cloak off him and put his robes on him and led him away to crucify {him}.


## Matthew 27:32 (id: 940027032)

32Now coming out, they found a Cyrenean man, Simon by name. They pressed this one into service so that he would carry his cross.


## Matthew 27:33 (id: 940027033)

33And having come to a place called Golgotha, which is called Place of a Skull,


## Matthew 27:34 (id: 940027034)

34they gave him wine mixed with gall to drink. And having tasted {it}, he was not willing to drink {it}.


## Matthew 27:35 (id: 940027035)

35Now having crucified him, they divided up his robes, casting a lot,


## Matthew 27:36 (id: 940027036)

36and sitting down, they were guarding him there.


## Matthew 27:37 (id: 940027037)

37And they put above his head his charge, having been written, “This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.”


## Matthew 27:38 (id: 940027038)

38Then two robbers are being crucified with him, one at his right and one at his left.


## Matthew 27:39 (id: 940027039)

39But the ones passing by were blaspheming him, wagging their heads


## Matthew 27:40 (id: 940027040)

40and saying, “The one destroying the temple and in three days rebuilding {it}, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, also come down from the cross!”


## Matthew 27:41 (id: 940027041)

41Likewise also the chief priests, mocking {him} with the scribes and elders, were saying,


## Matthew 27:42 (id: 940027042)

42“He saved others; he is not able to save himself. He is the King of Israel! Let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him.


## Matthew 27:43 (id: 940027043)

43He has trusted in God; let him deliver {him} now, if he wants him. For he said, ‘I am the Son of God.’”


## Matthew 27:44 (id: 940027044)

44But also the robbers having being crucified with him were reviling him the same.


## Matthew 27:45 (id: 940027045)

45Now from the sixth hour darkness happened over all the land until the ninth hour.


## Matthew 27:46 (id: 940027046)

46But about the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, “Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?” This is, “My God, my God, why did you forsake me?”


## Matthew 27:47 (id: 940027047)

47But some of the ones having stood there, having heard {it}, were saying, “This one calls Elijah.”


## Matthew 27:48 (id: 940027048)

48And immediately one of them, having run and having taken a sponge, having both filled {it} with vinegar and put {it} around a reed, gave {it} to him to drink.


## Matthew 27:49 (id: 940027049)

49But the rest were saying, “Leave {him}! Let us see if Elijah comes, saving him.”


## Matthew 27:50 (id: 940027050)

50But Jesus, having cried out again with a loud voice, released his spirit.


## Matthew 27:51 (id: 940027051)

51And behold, the curtain of the temple was split in two from top to bottom, and the earth was shaken, and the rocks were split.


## Matthew 27:52 (id: 940027052)

52And the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints having fallen asleep were raised.


## Matthew 27:53 (id: 940027053)

53And having come out from the tombs after his resurrection, they entered into the holy city and appeared to many.


## Matthew 27:54 (id: 940027054)

54Now the centurion and the ones with him guarding Jesus, having seen the earthquake and the things having happened, were very afraid, saying, “Truly this was a Son of God.”


## Matthew 27:55 (id: 940027055)

55Now there were many women there, watching from a distance, who followed Jesus from Galilee, serving him.


## Matthew 27:56 (id: 940027056)

56Among them were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.


## Matthew 27:57 (id: 940027057)

57Now evening having come, a rich man from Arimathea came, Joseph by name, who also himself was discipled by Jesus.


## Matthew 27:58 (id: 940027058)

58This one, having approached Pilate, asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded {it} to be given {to him}.


## Matthew 27:59 (id: 940027059)

59And Joseph, having taken the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,


## Matthew 27:60 (id: 940027060)

60and put it in his own new tomb, which he had cut in the rock. And having rolled a large stone against the door of the tomb, he went away.


## Matthew 27:61 (id: 940027061)

61Now Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the tomb.


## Matthew 27:62 (id: 940027062)

62Now the next day, which is after the Day of Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together to Pilate,


## Matthew 27:63 (id: 940027063)

63saying, “Lord, we remember that that deceiver said, still living, ‘After three days I am being raised up.’


## Matthew 27:64 (id: 940027064)

64Therefore, command the tomb to be secured until the third day, lest his disciples, having come, might steal him and say to the people, ‘He has been raised up from the dead,’ and the last deception will be worse than the first.”


## Matthew 27:65 (id: 940027065)

65And Pilate said to them, “You have a guard. Go, secure {it} as you know.”


## Matthew 27:66 (id: 940027066)

66And they, having gone, secured the tomb, having sealed the stone, with the guard.


## Matthew 28:1 (id: 940028001)

1Now after the Sabbath, at the dawning on the first of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to watch the tomb.


## Matthew 28:2 (id: 940028002)

2And behold, a great earthquake happened, for an angel of the Lord, having come down from heaven and having approached, rolled away the stone and was sitting on it.


## Matthew 28:3 (id: 940028003)

3Now his appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow.


## Matthew 28:4 (id: 940028004)

4And the ones guarding were shaken from the fear of him and became as dead.


## Matthew 28:5 (id: 940028005)

5But answering, the angel said to the women, “You, do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus, the one having been crucified.


## Matthew 28:6 (id: 940028006)

6He is not here, for he was raised up, just as he said. Come, see the place where he was lying.


## Matthew 28:7 (id: 940028007)

7And having gone quickly, say to his disciples, ‘He has been raised up from the dead. And behold, he is going before you to Galilee. There you will see him.’ Behold, I have said {it} to you.”


## Matthew 28:8 (id: 940028008)

8And having quickly gone away from the tomb with fear and great joy, they ran to report {this} to his disciples.


## Matthew 28:9 (id: 940028009)

9And behold, Jesus met them, saying, “Rejoice!” But they, having approached, seized his feet and worshiped him.


## Matthew 28:10 (id: 940028010)

10Then Jesus says to them, “Do not be afraid. Go, report {this} to my brothers so that they might go away to Galilee, and there they will see me.”


## Matthew 28:11 (id: 940028011)

11Now they going, behold, some of the guard, having come into the city, reported to the chief priests all the things having happened.


## Matthew 28:12 (id: 940028012)

12And having been gathered together with the elders, and having taken counsel, they gave many pieces of silver to the soldiers,


## Matthew 28:13 (id: 940028013)

13saying, “Say, ‘His disciples, having come at night, stole him, we sleeping.’


## Matthew 28:14 (id: 940028014)

14And if this is heard by the governor, we will persuade and make you free from concern.”


## Matthew 28:15 (id: 940028015)

15And they, having taken the pieces of silver, did as they were taught. And this word has been reported among the Jews until today.


## Matthew 28:16 (id: 940028016)

16Now the 11 disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had directed them.


## Matthew 28:17 (id: 940028017)

17And having seen him, they worshiped, but they doubted.


## Matthew 28:18 (id: 940028018)

18And having approached, Jesus spoke to them, saying, “All authority was given to me in heaven and on the earth.


## Matthew 28:19 (id: 940028019)

19Having gone, therefore, disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit;


## Matthew 28:20 (id: 940028020)

20teaching them to keep everything, as much as I commanded you. And behold, I am with you all the days, until the end of the age.”
