## Ezekiel 1:1 (id: 926001001)

1In the thirtieth year, the fourth month, and the fifth day of the month, it came about that I was living among the captives by the Kebar Canal. The heavens opened, and I saw visions of God.


## Ezekiel 1:2 (id: 926001002)

2On the fifth day of that month—it was the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiachin—


## Ezekiel 1:3 (id: 926001003)

3the word of Yahweh came to Ezekiel son of Buzi the priest, in the land of the Chaldeans by the Kebar Canal, and the hand of Yahweh was upon him there.


## Ezekiel 1:4 (id: 926001004)

4Then I looked, and there was a windstorm coming from the north; a great cloud with fire flashing within it and brightness surrounding it and inside of it, and the fire was the color of amber inside the cloud.


## Ezekiel 1:5 (id: 926001005)

5In the middle was the likeness of four living creatures. This was their appearance: They had the likeness of a man,


## Ezekiel 1:6 (id: 926001006)

6but they had four faces each, and each of the creatures had four wings.


## Ezekiel 1:7 (id: 926001007)

7Their legs were straight, but the soles of their feet were like the hooves of a calf that shone like polished bronze.


## Ezekiel 1:8 (id: 926001008)

8Yet they had human hands under their wings on all four sides. For all four, their faces and wings were like this:


## Ezekiel 1:9 (id: 926001009)

9their wings were touching the wings of the next creature, and they did not turn as they went; instead, each one went straight forward.


## Ezekiel 1:10 (id: 926001010)

10The likeness of their faces was like the face of a man. The four of them had the face of a lion to the right side, and the four of them had the face of an ox on the left side. They four had also the face of an eagle.


## Ezekiel 1:11 (id: 926001011)

11Their faces were like that, and their wings were spread out above, so that each creature had a pair of wings that touched another creature’s wing, and also a pair of wings that covered their bodies.


## Ezekiel 1:12 (id: 926001012)

12Each went straight forward, so that wherever the Spirit directed them to go, they went without turning.


## Ezekiel 1:13 (id: 926001013)

13As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches; bright fire also moved about among the creatures, and there were flashes of lightning.


## Ezekiel 1:14 (id: 926001014)

14The living creatures were moving swiftly back and forth, and they had the appearance of lightning!


## Ezekiel 1:15 (id: 926001015)

15Then I looked at the living creatures; and I saw one wheel on the ground beside each of living creatures with its four faces.


## Ezekiel 1:16 (id: 926001016)

16This was the appearance and structure of the wheels: Each wheel was like beryl, and the four had the same likeness; their appearance and structure was like a wheel intersecting another wheel.


## Ezekiel 1:17 (id: 926001017)

17As they moved, they went in any of their four directions, without turning as they went.


## Ezekiel 1:18 (id: 926001018)

18As for their rims, they were high and fearsome, for the rims were full of eyes round about.


## Ezekiel 1:19 (id: 926001019)

19Whenever the living creatures moved, the wheels moved beside them. When the living creatures rose up from the earth, the wheels also rose up.


## Ezekiel 1:20 (id: 926001020)

20Wherever the Spirit would go, they went, and the wheels rose up beside them, for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.


## Ezekiel 1:21 (id: 926001021)

21Whenever the creatures moved, the wheels also moved; and when the creatures stood still, the wheels stood still; when the creatures rose up from the earth, the wheels rose up beside them, because the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.


## Ezekiel 1:22 (id: 926001022)

22Over the heads of the living creatures was the likeness of an expansive dome; it looked like awe\-inspiring crystal stretched out over their heads above.


## Ezekiel 1:23 (id: 926001023)

23Beneath the dome, each one of the creature’s wings stretched out straight and touched another creature’s wings. Each of the living creatures also had a pair to cover themselves; each had a pair to cover his own body.


## Ezekiel 1:24 (id: 926001024)

24Then I heard the sound of their wings. Like the noise of many waters. Like the voice of the Almighty whenever they moved. Like the sound of a rainstorm. Like the sound of an army. Whenever they stood still, they lowered their wings.


## Ezekiel 1:25 (id: 926001025)

25A voice came from above the dome over their heads whenever they stood still and lowered their wings.


## Ezekiel 1:26 (id: 926001026)

26Above the dome over their heads was the likeness of a throne that was like the appearance of a sapphire stone, and on the likeness of the throne was a likeness like the appearance of a man.


## Ezekiel 1:27 (id: 926001027)

27I saw a figure with the appearance of glowing metal with fire in it from the appearance of his hips up; I saw from the appearance of his hips downward the appearance of fire and brightness all around.


## Ezekiel 1:28 (id: 926001028)

28Like the appearance of a rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day was the appearance of the bright light surrounding it. It was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Yahweh. When I saw it, I fell on my face, and I heard a voice speaking.


## Ezekiel 2:1 (id: 926002001)

1He said to me, “Son of man, stand up on your feet; then I will speak to you.”


## Ezekiel 2:2 (id: 926002002)

2Then, as he spoke to me, the Spirit entered into me and set me on my feet, and I heard him speaking to me.


## Ezekiel 2:3 (id: 926002003)

3He said to me, “Son of man, I am sending you to the people of Israel, to rebellious nations that have rebelled against me—both they and their ancestors have sinned against me up to this very day!


## Ezekiel 2:4 (id: 926002004)

4Their descendants have stubborn faces and hard hearts. I am sending you to them, and you will say to them, ‘This is what the Lord Yahweh says.’


## Ezekiel 2:5 (id: 926002005)

5Either they will listen or they will not listen. They are a rebellious house, but they will at least know that a prophet has been among them.


## Ezekiel 2:6 (id: 926002006)

6You, son of man, do not be afraid of them or their words. Do not be afraid, although you are with briers and thorns and although you live with scorpions. Do not fear their words or be dismayed by their faces, since they are a rebellious house.


## Ezekiel 2:7 (id: 926002007)

7But you will speak my words to them, whether they listen or not, because they are most rebellious.


## Ezekiel 2:8 (id: 926002008)

8But you, son of man, listen to what I am saying to you. Do not be rebellious like that rebellious house. Open your mouth and eat what I am about to give to you!”


## Ezekiel 2:9 (id: 926002009)

9Then I looked, and a hand was extended out to me; in it was a written scroll.


## Ezekiel 2:10 (id: 926002010)

10He spread it out before me; it had been written on both its front and back, and written on it were lamentations, mourning, and woe.


## Ezekiel 3:1 (id: 926003001)

1He said to me, “Son of man, what you have found, eat. Eat this scroll, then go speak to the house of Israel.”


## Ezekiel 3:2 (id: 926003002)

2So I opened my mouth, and he fed me that scroll.


## Ezekiel 3:3 (id: 926003003)

3He said to me, “Son of man, feed your belly and fill your stomach with this scroll that I have given to you!” So I ate it, and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth.


## Ezekiel 3:4 (id: 926003004)

4Then he said to me, “Son of man, go to the house of Israel and speak my words to them.


## Ezekiel 3:5 (id: 926003005)

5For you are not being sent to a people of strange speech or difficult language, but to the house of Israel—


## Ezekiel 3:6 (id: 926003006)

6not to many peoples of strange speech or a difficult language, whose words you cannot understand. Surely if I sent you to them, they would have listened to you.


## Ezekiel 3:7 (id: 926003007)

7But the house of Israel will not be willing to listen to you, for they are not willing to listen to me. So all the house of Israel is strong browed and hard hearted.


## Ezekiel 3:8 (id: 926003008)

8Behold! I have made your face as hard as their faces and your brow as hard as their brows.


## Ezekiel 3:9 (id: 926003009)

9I have made your brow like a diamond, harder than flint! Do not fear them or be discouraged by their faces, since they are a rebellious house.”


## Ezekiel 3:10 (id: 926003010)

10Then he said to me, “Son of man, all the words that I announce to you—take them into your heart and hear them with your ears!


## Ezekiel 3:11 (id: 926003011)

11Then go to the captives, to your people, and speak to them. Say to them, ‘This is what the Lord Yahweh says,’ whether they will listen or not.”


## Ezekiel 3:12 (id: 926003012)

12Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the sound of a great earthquake: “Blessed be the glory of Yahweh from his place!”


## Ezekiel 3:13 (id: 926003013)

13It was the sound of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another, and the sound of the wheels that were with them, and the sound of a great earthquake.


## Ezekiel 3:14 (id: 926003014)

14The Spirit lifted me up and took me away, and I went with bitterness in my spirit’s rage, for the hand of Yahweh was powerfully pressing on me!


## Ezekiel 3:15 (id: 926003015)

15So I went to the captives at Tel Aviv who lived along the Kebar Canal, and I stayed there among them for seven days, overwhelmed in amazement.


## Ezekiel 3:16 (id: 926003016)

16Then it happened after seven days that the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 3:17 (id: 926003017)

17“Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel, so listen to the word from my mouth, and give them my warning.


## Ezekiel 3:18 (id: 926003018)

18When I say to the wicked, ‘You will surely die’ and you do not warn him or speak a warning to the wicked about his evil deeds so he might live—the wicked one will die for his sin, but I will require his blood from your hand.


## Ezekiel 3:19 (id: 926003019)

19But if you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness or from his wicked deeds, then he will die for his sin, but you will have rescued your own life.


## Ezekiel 3:20 (id: 926003020)

20If a righteous man turns from his righteousness and acts unjustly, and I set a stumbling block before him, he will die. Because you did not warn him, he will die in his sin, and I will not call to mind the righteous deeds that he performed, but I will require his blood from your hand.


## Ezekiel 3:21 (id: 926003021)

21But if you warn the righteous man to stop sinning so that he no longer sins, he will surely live since he was warned; and you will have rescued your own life.”


## Ezekiel 3:22 (id: 926003022)

22So the hand of Yahweh was on me there, and he said to me, “Arise! Go out into the plain, and I will speak with you there!”


## Ezekiel 3:23 (id: 926003023)

23I arose and went out into the plain, and there the glory of Yahweh was staying, like the glory that I had seen beside the Kebar Canal; so I fell on my face.


## Ezekiel 3:24 (id: 926003024)

24The Spirit came to me and stood me up on my feet; and he spoke with me, and said to me, “Go and shut yourself up within your house,


## Ezekiel 3:25 (id: 926003025)

25for now, son of man, they will place ropes upon you and tie you so you cannot go out among them.


## Ezekiel 3:26 (id: 926003026)

26I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth, so you will be mute, and you will not be able to rebuke them, since they are a rebellious house.


## Ezekiel 3:27 (id: 926003027)

27But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth so you will say to them, ‘This is what the Lord Yahweh says.’ The one who will hear will hear; the one who will not listen will not listen, for they are a rebellious house!”


## Ezekiel 4:1 (id: 926004001)

1“But you, son of man, take a brick for yourself and place it before you. Then carve the city of Jerusalem on it.


## Ezekiel 4:2 (id: 926004002)

2Then lay siege against it, and build forts against it. Raise up an assault ramp against it and set camps around it. Place battering rams all around it.


## Ezekiel 4:3 (id: 926004003)

3Then take for yourself an iron pan and use it as an iron wall between yourself and the city and set your face against it, for it will be under siege, and you are to put the siege against it. This will be a sign to the house of Israel.


## Ezekiel 4:4 (id: 926004004)

4Then, lie on your left side and put the sin of the house of Israel on it; you will carry their sin for the number of the days that you lie down against the house of Israel.


## Ezekiel 4:5 (id: 926004005)

5I myself am assigning to you one day to represent each year of their punishment: 390 days! In this way, you will carry the sin of the house of Israel.


## Ezekiel 4:6 (id: 926004006)

6When you have completed these days, then lie down a second time on your right side, for you will carry the sin of the house of Judah for forty days. I am assigning to you one day for each year.


## Ezekiel 4:7 (id: 926004007)

7Set your face toward Jerusalem that is under siege, and with your arm uncovered prophesy against it.


## Ezekiel 4:8 (id: 926004008)

8For behold! I am placing bonds on you so you will not turn from one side to the other until you have completed the days of your siege.


## Ezekiel 4:9 (id: 926004009)

9Take for yourself wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt; put them in a single container and make bread for yourself according to the number of the days that you will lie upon your side. For 390 days you will eat it.


## Ezekiel 4:10 (id: 926004010)

10The food you will eat will be by weight, twenty shekels per day, and you will eat it at set times each day.


## Ezekiel 4:11 (id: 926004011)

11Then you will drink water, measured out to a sixth of a hin, and you will drink it at set times.


## Ezekiel 4:12 (id: 926004012)

12You will eat it as barley cakes, but you will bake it on excrement of human dung within their sight!”


## Ezekiel 4:13 (id: 926004013)

13For Yahweh says, “This means that the bread that the people of Israel will eat will be unclean, there among the nations where I will banish them.”


## Ezekiel 4:14 (id: 926004014)

14But I said, “Alas, Lord Yahweh! I have never been unclean! I have never eaten either anything that died or anything killed by animals, from my youth until now, and foul meat has never entered my mouth!”


## Ezekiel 4:15 (id: 926004015)

15So he said to me, “Look! I have given you cow manure instead of human dung so you can prepare your bread over that.”


## Ezekiel 4:16 (id: 926004016)

16He also said to me, “Son of man! Behold! I am breaking the staff of bread in Jerusalem, and they will eat bread while rationing it in anxiety and drink water while rationing it in trembling.


## Ezekiel 4:17 (id: 926004017)

17Because they will lack bread and water, every man will be dismayed at his brother and waste away because of their iniquity.”


## Ezekiel 5:1 (id: 926005001)

1“Then you, son of man, take a sharp sword as a barber’s razor for yourself, and pass the razor over your head and your beard, then take scales to weigh and divide your hair.


## Ezekiel 5:2 (id: 926005002)

2Burn a third of it with fire in the midst of the city when the days of the siege are completed, and take a third of the hair and strike it with the sword all around the city. Then scatter a third of it to the wind, and I will draw out a sword to chase after the people.


## Ezekiel 5:3 (id: 926005003)

3But take a small number of hairs from them and tie them into the folds of your robe.


## Ezekiel 5:4 (id: 926005004)

4Then take more of the hair and throw it into the midst of the fire; and burn it in the fire; from there a fire will go out to all the house of Israel.”


## Ezekiel 5:5 (id: 926005005)

5The Lord Yahweh says this, “This is Jerusalem in the midst of the nations, where I have placed her, and where I have surrounded her with other lands.


## Ezekiel 5:6 (id: 926005006)

6But she has in wickedness rejected my decrees more than the nations have, and my statutes more than the countries that surround her. The people have rejected my judgments and have not walked in my statutes.”


## Ezekiel 5:7 (id: 926005007)

7Therefore the Lord Yahweh says this, “Because you are more troublesome than the nations that surround you and have not walked in my statutes or acted according to my decrees, or even acted according to the decrees of the nations that surround you,”


## Ezekiel 5:8 (id: 926005008)

8therefore the Lord Yahweh says this, “Behold! I myself will act against you. I will execute judgments within your midst for the nations to see.


## Ezekiel 5:9 (id: 926005009)

9I will do to you what I have not done and the like of which I will not do again, because of all your disgusting actions.


## Ezekiel 5:10 (id: 926005010)

10Therefore fathers will eat the children in your midst, and sons will eat their fathers, since I will execute judgment on you and scatter to every direction all of you who are left.


## Ezekiel 5:11 (id: 926005011)

11Therefore, as I live—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration—it is certainly because you have defiled my sanctuary with all your hateful things and with all your disgusting deeds, that I myself will reduce you in number; my eye will not have pity on you, and I will not spare you.


## Ezekiel 5:12 (id: 926005012)

12A third of you will die by plague, and they will be consumed by famine in your midst. A third will fall by the sword surrounding you. Then I will scatter a third in every direction, and draw out a sword to chase after them as well.


## Ezekiel 5:13 (id: 926005013)

13Then my wrath will be completed, and I will cause my fury toward them to rest. I will be satisfied, and they will know that I, Yahweh, have spoken in my wrath when I have completed my fury against them.


## Ezekiel 5:14 (id: 926005014)

14I will make you a desolation and a reproach to the nations that surround you in the sight of everyone who passes by.


## Ezekiel 5:15 (id: 926005015)

15So Jerusalem will become something for other people to condemn and to mock, a warning and a horror to the nations that surround you. I will execute judgments against you in wrath and fury, and with a furious rebuke—I, Yahweh have declared this!


## Ezekiel 5:16 (id: 926005016)

16I will send out harsh arrows of famine against you that will become the means with which I will destroy you. For I will increase the famine on you and break your staff of bread.


## Ezekiel 5:17 (id: 926005017)

17I will send a famine and disasters against you so you will be childless. Plague and blood will pass through you, and I will bring a sword against you—I, Yahweh, have declared this.”


## Ezekiel 6:1 (id: 926006001)

1The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 6:2 (id: 926006002)

2“Son of man, set your face against the mountains of Israel and prophesy to them.


## Ezekiel 6:3 (id: 926006003)

3Say, ‘Mountains of Israel, listen to the word of the Lord Yahweh! The Lord Yahweh says this to the mountains and to the hills, to the streambeds, and to the valleys: Behold! I am bringing a sword against you, and I will destroy your high places.


## Ezekiel 6:4 (id: 926006004)

4Then your altars will become desolate and your pillars will be destroyed, and I will throw down your dead in front of their idols.


## Ezekiel 6:5 (id: 926006005)

5I will lay the dead bodies of the people of Israel before their idols, and scatter your bones around your altars.


## Ezekiel 6:6 (id: 926006006)

6Everywhere you live, cities will be laid waste and the high places ruined, so that your altars will be laid waste and made desolate. Then they will be broken and disappear, your pillars will be cut down and your works will be wiped away.


## Ezekiel 6:7 (id: 926006007)

7The dead will fall down in your midst and you will know that I am Yahweh.


## Ezekiel 6:8 (id: 926006008)

8But I will preserve a remnant among you, and there will be some who escape the sword among the nations, when you are scattered throughout the countries.


## Ezekiel 6:9 (id: 926006009)

9Then those who escape will think of me among the nations where they will be held captive, that I was grieved by their promiscuous heart that turned away from me, and by their eyes that whored after their idols. Then they will show loathing on their face for the wickedness which they have committed with all their abominations.


## Ezekiel 6:10 (id: 926006010)

10So they will know that I am Yahweh. It was for a reason that I said I would bring this evil to them.


## Ezekiel 6:11 (id: 926006011)

11The Lord Yahweh says this: Clap your hands and stomp your foot! Say, ‘Alas!’ because of all the evil abominations of the house of Israel! For they will fall by sword, famine, and plague.


## Ezekiel 6:12 (id: 926006012)

12The one far away will die by plague, and the one who is near will fall by the sword. Those who remain and survive will die by famine. In this way I will accomplish my fury against them.


## Ezekiel 6:13 (id: 926006013)

13Then you will know that I am Yahweh, when their dead lie among their idols, around their altars, on every high hill—on all the mountain peaks, and under every flourishing tree and thick oak—the places where they burned incense to all their idols.


## Ezekiel 6:14 (id: 926006014)

14I will strike with my hand and make the land desolate and a waste, from the wilderness to Diblah, throughout all the places where they live. Then they will know that I am Yahweh.”


## Ezekiel 7:1 (id: 926007001)

1The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 7:2 (id: 926007002)

2“You, son of man—the Lord Yahweh says this to the land of Israel.” ‘An end! An end has come to the four borders of the land.


## Ezekiel 7:3 (id: 926007003)

3Now the end is upon you, for I am sending out my wrath on you, and I will judge you according to your ways; then I will bring all your abominations upon you.


## Ezekiel 7:4 (id: 926007004)

4For my eyes will not pity you, and I will not spare you. Instead, I will bring your ways upon you, and your abominations will be in your midst, so you will know that I am Yahweh.


## Ezekiel 7:5 (id: 926007005)

5The Lord Yahweh says this: Disaster! A unique disaster! Behold, it is coming.


## Ezekiel 7:6 (id: 926007006)

6An end is surely coming. The end has woken up against you. Behold, it is coming!


## Ezekiel 7:7 (id: 926007007)

7Your doom is coming to you who inhabit the land. The time has come; the day of destruction is near, and the mountains will no longer be joyful.


## Ezekiel 7:8 (id: 926007008)

8Now before long I will pour out my fury against you and fill up my wrath upon you when I judge you according to your ways and bring all your abominations upon you.


## Ezekiel 7:9 (id: 926007009)

9For my eye will not look compassionately, and I will not spare you. As you have done, I will do to you; and your abominations will be in your midst so you will know that I am Yahweh, the one punishing you.


## Ezekiel 7:10 (id: 926007010)

10Behold, the day! Behold, it is coming! Doom has gone out! The rod has blossomed, arrogance has budded!


## Ezekiel 7:11 (id: 926007011)

11Violence has grown up into a rod of wickedness— none of them, and none of their multitude, none of their wealth, and none of their importance will last!


## Ezekiel 7:12 (id: 926007012)

12The time is coming; the day has come close. Do not let the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn, since my anger is on the entire multitude!


## Ezekiel 7:13 (id: 926007013)

13For the seller will not return to the land he sold as long as they both live, because the vision concerning the entire multitude will not be reversed; and because of their sins, none of them will be strengthened!


## Ezekiel 7:14 (id: 926007014)

14They have blown the trumpet and made everything ready, but there is no one marching to battle; since my anger is on the entire multitude.


## Ezekiel 7:15 (id: 926007015)

15The sword is on the outside, and plague and famine are inside the building. Those who are in the field will die by the sword, while famine and plague will consume those in the city.


## Ezekiel 7:16 (id: 926007016)

16But some survivors will escape from among them, and they will go to the mountains. Like doves of the valleys, all of them will moan—each man for his iniquity.


## Ezekiel 7:17 (id: 926007017)

17Every hand will falter and every knee will be weak as water,


## Ezekiel 7:18 (id: 926007018)

18and they will wear sackcloth, and terror will cover them; and shame will be on every face, and baldness on all of their heads.


## Ezekiel 7:19 (id: 926007019)

19They will throw their silver into the streets and their gold will be like refuse. Their silver and their gold will not be able to rescue them in the day of Yahweh’s rage. Their lives will not be saved, and their hunger will not be satisfied, because their iniquity has become a stumbling block.


## Ezekiel 7:20 (id: 926007020)

20In their pride they took the beauty of his jeweled ornaments, and with them they made their idolatrous figures, and their detestable things. Therefore, I am turning these into an unclean thing to them.


## Ezekiel 7:21 (id: 926007021)

21Then I will give those things into the hand of strangers as plunder and to the wicked of the earth as plunder, and they will defile them.


## Ezekiel 7:22 (id: 926007022)

22Then I will turn my face away from them when they defile my cherished place; bandits will enter it and defile it.


## Ezekiel 7:23 (id: 926007023)

23Make a chain, because the land is filled with the judgment of blood, and the city is full of violence.


## Ezekiel 7:24 (id: 926007024)

24So I will bring the most wicked of the nations, and they will possess their houses, and I will bring an end to the pride of the mighty, for their holy places will be defiled!


## Ezekiel 7:25 (id: 926007025)

25Fear will come! They will seek peace, but there will be none.


## Ezekiel 7:26 (id: 926007026)

26Disaster upon disaster will come, and there will be rumor after rumor. Then they will seek a vision from the prophet, but the law will perish from the priest and advice from the elders.


## Ezekiel 7:27 (id: 926007027)

27The king will mourn and the prince will dress in despair, while the hands of the people of the land will tremble in fear. According to their own ways I will do this to them! I will judge them with their own standards until they know that I am Yahweh.’”


## Ezekiel 8:1 (id: 926008001)

1So it came about in the sixth year and the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord Yahweh again fell upon me there.


## Ezekiel 8:2 (id: 926008002)

2So I looked, and behold, there was a likeness with the appearance of a man. From the appearance of his hips downward there was fire. And from his hips upward there was the appearance of something shining, like glowing metal.


## Ezekiel 8:3 (id: 926008003)

3Then he reached out the form of a hand and took me by the hair of my head; the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven, and in visions from God, he brought me to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the inner northern gate, where the idol that provokes great jealousy was standing.


## Ezekiel 8:4 (id: 926008004)

4Then behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the vision I had seen on the plain.


## Ezekiel 8:5 (id: 926008005)

5Then he said to me, “Son of man, lift up your eyes to the north.” So I lifted up my eyes to the north, and to the north of the gate leading to the altar, there in the entrance, was the idol of jealousy.


## Ezekiel 8:6 (id: 926008006)

6So he said to me, “Son of man, do you see what they are doing? These are great abominations that the house of Israel is doing here to make me go far from my own sanctuary. But you will turn and see even greater abominations.”


## Ezekiel 8:7 (id: 926008007)

7Then he brought me to the doorway of the courtyard, and I looked, and there was a hole in the wall.


## Ezekiel 8:8 (id: 926008008)

8He said to me, “Son of man, dig into this wall.” So I dug into the wall, and there was a door.


## Ezekiel 8:9 (id: 926008009)

9Then he said to me, “Go and see the wicked abominations that they are doing here.”


## Ezekiel 8:10 (id: 926008010)

10So I went in and looked, and behold! There was every form of creeping thing and detestable beast! Every idol of the house of Israel was carved into the wall all around.


## Ezekiel 8:11 (id: 926008011)

11Seventy elders of the house of Israel were there, and Jaazaniah son of Shaphan was standing in their midst. They were standing in front of the images, and each man had his censer in his hand so that the smell of the cloud of incense went up.


## Ezekiel 8:12 (id: 926008012)

12He said to me, “Son of man, do you see what the elders of the house of Israel are doing in the dark? Each one does this in the hidden chamber of his idol, for they say, ‘Yahweh does not see us! Yahweh has forsaken the land.’”


## Ezekiel 8:13 (id: 926008013)

13Then he said to me, “Turn again and see the other great abominations that they are doing.”


## Ezekiel 8:14 (id: 926008014)

14Next he brought me to the entrance of the gate of Yahweh’s house that was on the north side, and behold! The women were sitting there mourning for Tammuz.


## Ezekiel 8:15 (id: 926008015)

15So he said to me, “Do you see this, son of man? Turn again and see even greater abominations than these.”


## Ezekiel 8:16 (id: 926008016)

16He brought me into the inner courtyard of Yahweh’s house, and behold! at the entrance of the temple of Yahweh between the portico and the altar, there were about twenty\-five men with their backs toward the temple of Yahweh and their faces toward the east, and they were worshiping the sun.


## Ezekiel 8:17 (id: 926008017)

17He said to me, “Do you see this, son of man? Is it a little thing for the house of Judah to do these abominations that they are doing here? For they have filled the land with violence and they have turned again to provoke me to anger, putting the branch to their noses.


## Ezekiel 8:18 (id: 926008018)

18So I will also act among them; my eye will not have compassion, and I will not spare them. Though they cry in my ears with a loud voice, I will not hear them.”


## Ezekiel 9:1 (id: 926009001)

1Then he cried in my hearing with a loud voice, and said, “Let the guards come up to the city, each with his weapon of destruction in his hand.”


## Ezekiel 9:2 (id: 926009002)

2Then behold! Six men came from the pathway of the upper gate that faces north, each with his weapon of slaughter in his hand. There was a man in their midst dressed in linen with a scribe’s equipment at his side. So they went in and stood beside the bronze altar.


## Ezekiel 9:3 (id: 926009003)

3Then the glory of the God of Israel went up from the cherubim where it had been to the threshold of the house. He called to the man dressed in linen who had the scribe’s equipment at his side.


## Ezekiel 9:4 (id: 926009004)

4Yahweh said to him, “Pass through the midst of the city—the midst of Jerusalem—and make a mark on the foreheads of those who groan and sigh about all the abominations being performed in the midst of the city.”


## Ezekiel 9:5 (id: 926009005)

5Then he spoke to the others within my hearing, “Pass through the city after him and kill. Do not let your eyes have compassion, and do not spare


## Ezekiel 9:6 (id: 926009006)

6either old man, young man, virgin, little children or women. Kill all of them! But do not approach anyone who has the mark on his head. Begin at my sanctuary!” So they began with the elders who were in front of the house.


## Ezekiel 9:7 (id: 926009007)

7He said to them, “Defile the house, and fill its courtyards with the dead. Proceed!” So they went out and attacked the city.


## Ezekiel 9:8 (id: 926009008)

8As they were attacking it, I found myself alone and I fell on my face and cried out and said, “Ah, Lord Yahweh, will you destroy all the remnant of Israel in the outpouring of your wrath on Jerusalem?”


## Ezekiel 9:9 (id: 926009009)

9He said to me, “The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great. The land is full of blood and the city full of perversions, since they say, ‘Yahweh has forgotten the land,’ and ‘Yahweh does not see!’


## Ezekiel 9:10 (id: 926009010)

10So then, my eye will not look with compassion, and I will not spare them. I will instead bring it all on their heads.”


## Ezekiel 9:11 (id: 926009011)

11Behold! The man dressed in linen who had the scribe’s equipment by his side came back. He reported and said, “I have done all that you have commanded.”


## Ezekiel 10:1 (id: 926010001)

1As I looked toward the dome that was over the heads of the cherubim; something appeared above them like a sapphire with the appearance of the likeness of a throne.


## Ezekiel 10:2 (id: 926010002)

2Then Yahweh spoke to the man dressed in linen and said, “Go between the wheels underneath the cherubim, and fill both your hands with fiery coals from between the cherubim and scatter them over the city.” Then the man went in as I watched.


## Ezekiel 10:3 (id: 926010003)

3The cherubim stood on the right side of the house when the man went in, and a cloud filled the inner courtyard.


## Ezekiel 10:4 (id: 926010004)

4The glory of Yahweh rose up from the cherubim and stood over the threshold of the house. It filled the house with the cloud, and the courtyard was full of the brightness of Yahweh’s glory.


## Ezekiel 10:5 (id: 926010005)

5The sound of the cherubim’s wings was heard as far as the outer courtyard, like the voice of God Almighty when he speaks.


## Ezekiel 10:6 (id: 926010006)

6It came about, when God commanded the man dressed in linen and said, “Take fire from between the wheels that are between the cherubim,” the man went in and stood beside a wheel.


## Ezekiel 10:7 (id: 926010007)

7A cherub reached out his hand between the cherubim to the fire that was among the cherubim, and lifted it up and placed it into the hands of the one dressed in linen. The man took it and went back out.


## Ezekiel 10:8 (id: 926010008)

8I saw on the cherubim something like a man’s hand under their wings.


## Ezekiel 10:9 (id: 926010009)

9So I looked, and behold! Four wheels were beside the cherubim—one wheel beside each cherub—and the appearance of the wheels was like a beryl stone.


## Ezekiel 10:10 (id: 926010010)

10Their appearance was the same likeness for all four of them, like a wheel intersecting another wheel.


## Ezekiel 10:11 (id: 926010011)

11When they moved, they went in any of their four directions, without turning as they went; but whatever direction the head faced, they followed after it without turning as they went.


## Ezekiel 10:12 (id: 926010012)

12Their whole body—including their backs, their hands, and their wings—was covered with eyes, and eyes covered the four wheels all around also.


## Ezekiel 10:13 (id: 926010013)

13As I listened, the wheels were called, “Whirling.”


## Ezekiel 10:14 (id: 926010014)

14They had four faces each; the first face was the face of a cherub, the second face was the face of a man, the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.


## Ezekiel 10:15 (id: 926010015)

15Then the cherubim—these were the living creatures that I had seen by the Kebar Canal—rose up.


## Ezekiel 10:16 (id: 926010016)

16Whenever the cherubim moved, the wheels would go beside them, and whenever the cherubim lifted up their wings to rise up from the earth, the wheels did not turn. They still stayed beside them.


## Ezekiel 10:17 (id: 926010017)

17When the cherubim stood still, the wheels stood still, and when they rose up, the wheels rose up with them, for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.


## Ezekiel 10:18 (id: 926010018)

18Then the glory of Yahweh went out from over the threshold of the house and stood over the cherubim.


## Ezekiel 10:19 (id: 926010019)

19The cherubim lifted up their wings and rose from the earth in my sight when they went out, and the wheels did the same beside them. They stood at the eastern entrance to Yahweh’s house, and the glory of the God of Israel came upon them from above.


## Ezekiel 10:20 (id: 926010020)

20These were the living creatures that I had seen below the God of Israel by the Kebar Canal, so I knew that they were cherubim!


## Ezekiel 10:21 (id: 926010021)

21They had four faces each and four wings each, and the likeness of human hands under their wings,


## Ezekiel 10:22 (id: 926010022)

22and the likeness of their faces was like the faces that I had seen in the vision at the Kebar Canal, and each of them went straight ahead.


## Ezekiel 11:1 (id: 926011001)

1Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the eastern gate of Yahweh’s house, facing east, and behold, in the doorway of the gate there were twenty\-five men. I saw Jaazaniah son of Azzur and Pelatiah son of Benaiah, leaders of the people, among them.


## Ezekiel 11:2 (id: 926011002)

2God said to me, “Son of man, these are the men who devise iniquity, and who decide wicked plans in this city.


## Ezekiel 11:3 (id: 926011003)

3They are saying, ‘The time to build houses is not now; this city is the pot, and we are the meat.’


## Ezekiel 11:4 (id: 926011004)

4Therefore prophesy against them. Prophesy, son of man.”


## Ezekiel 11:5 (id: 926011005)

5Then the Spirit of Yahweh fell on me and he said for me to say: This is what Yahweh says, “That is what you are saying, house of Israel; for I know what goes through your mind.


## Ezekiel 11:6 (id: 926011006)

6You have multiplied the people you have killed in this city and filled its streets with them.


## Ezekiel 11:7 (id: 926011007)

7Therefore, the Lord Yahweh says this: The people you have killed, whose bodies you have laid in the midst of Jerusalem, are the meat, and this city is the pot. But you are going to be brought out from the midst of this city.


## Ezekiel 11:8 (id: 926011008)

8You have feared the sword, so I am bringing the sword upon you—this is the declaration of the Lord Yahweh.


## Ezekiel 11:9 (id: 926011009)

9I will bring you out of the midst of the city, and put you into the hands of foreigners, for I will bring judgment against you.


## Ezekiel 11:10 (id: 926011010)

10You will fall by the sword. I will judge you within the borders of Israel so you will know that I am Yahweh.


## Ezekiel 11:11 (id: 926011011)

11This city will not be your cooking pot, nor will you be the meat within her midst. I will judge you within the borders of Israel.


## Ezekiel 11:12 (id: 926011012)

12Then you will know that I am Yahweh, the one whose statutes you have not walked in and whose decrees you have not carried out. Instead, you have carried out the decrees of the nations that surround you.”


## Ezekiel 11:13 (id: 926011013)

13It came about that as I was prophesying, Pelatiah son of Benaiah, died. So I fell on my face and cried out with a loud voice and said, “Alas, Lord Yahweh, will you completely destroy the remnant of Israel?”


## Ezekiel 11:14 (id: 926011014)

14The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 11:15 (id: 926011015)

15“Son of man, your brothers! Your brothers! The men of your clan and all the house of Israel! All of them are those of whom it is said by those living in Jerusalem, ‘They are far away from Yahweh! This land was given to us as our possession.’


## Ezekiel 11:16 (id: 926011016)

16Therefore say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Though I have removed them far off among the nations, and though I have scattered them among the lands, yet I have been a sanctuary for them for a little while in the lands where they have gone.’


## Ezekiel 11:17 (id: 926011017)

17Therefore say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: I will gather you from the peoples, and assemble you from the lands where you were scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.’


## Ezekiel 11:18 (id: 926011018)

18Then they will go there and remove every detestable thing and every abomination from that place.


## Ezekiel 11:19 (id: 926011019)

19I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within them. I will take out the heart of stone from their flesh and give them a heart of flesh,


## Ezekiel 11:20 (id: 926011020)

20so that they will walk in my statutes, they will carry out my decrees and do them. Then they will be my people, and I will be their God.


## Ezekiel 11:21 (id: 926011021)

21But to those who walk with affection toward their detestable things and their abominations, I will bring their conduct on their own heads—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.”


## Ezekiel 11:22 (id: 926011022)

22The cherubim lifted up their wings and the wheels that were beside them, and the glory of the God of Israel was high up over them.


## Ezekiel 11:23 (id: 926011023)

23Then the glory of Yahweh went up from within the midst of the city and stood on the mountain to the east of the city.


## Ezekiel 11:24 (id: 926011024)

24The Spirit lifted me up and brought me into Chaldea, to the exiles, in the vision from the Spirit of God, and the vision that I had seen went up from upon me.


## Ezekiel 11:25 (id: 926011025)

25Then I declared to the exiles all the things of Yahweh that I had seen.


## Ezekiel 12:1 (id: 926012001)

1The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 12:2 (id: 926012002)

2“Son of man, you live in the midst of a rebellious house, where they have eyes to see but they do not see; and where they have ears to hear but do not listen, because they are a rebellious house.


## Ezekiel 12:3 (id: 926012003)

3Therefore as for you, son of man, prepare your things for exile, and begin going out by day in their sight, for I will exile you in their sight from your place to another place. Perhaps they will begin to see, though they are a rebellious house.


## Ezekiel 12:4 (id: 926012004)

4You will bring out your things for an exile in the day in their sight; go out in the evening in their sight in the way that anyone goes into exile.


## Ezekiel 12:5 (id: 926012005)

5Dig a hole through the wall in their sight, and go out through it.


## Ezekiel 12:6 (id: 926012006)

6In their sight, lift up your things onto your shoulder, and bring them out in the darkness. Cover your face, for you must not see the land, since I have set you as a sign to the house of Israel.”


## Ezekiel 12:7 (id: 926012007)

7So I did this, just as I was commanded. I brought out my things of exile in the daytime, and in the evening I dug a hole through the wall by hand. I brought my things out in the dark, and lifted them up on my shoulder in their sight.


## Ezekiel 12:8 (id: 926012008)

8Then the word of Yahweh came to me in the morning, saying,


## Ezekiel 12:9 (id: 926012009)

9“Son of man, is the house of Israel, that rebellious house, not asking, ‘What are you doing?’


## Ezekiel 12:10 (id: 926012010)

10Say to them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: this prophetic action concerns the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel in whose midst they are.’


## Ezekiel 12:11 (id: 926012011)

11Say, ‘I am a sign to you.’ As I have done, so it will be done to them; they will go into exile and into captivity.


## Ezekiel 12:12 (id: 926012012)

12The prince who is among them will lift up his things upon his shoulder in the dark, and will go out through the wall. They will dig through the wall and bring out their things. He will cover his face, so he will not see the land with his eyes.


## Ezekiel 12:13 (id: 926012013)

13I will spread out my net over him and he will be caught in my snare; then I will bring him to Babylon, the land of the Chaldeans, but he will not see it. He will die there.


## Ezekiel 12:14 (id: 926012014)

14I will also scatter in every direction all of those around him who were to assist him and his entire army, and I will send out a sword after them.


## Ezekiel 12:15 (id: 926012015)

15Then they will know that I am Yahweh, when I scatter them among the nations and disperse them throughout the lands.


## Ezekiel 12:16 (id: 926012016)

16But I will spare a few men from among them from the sword, famine, and plague, so they may record all of their abominations in the lands where I take them, so they will know that I am Yahweh.”


## Ezekiel 12:17 (id: 926012017)

17The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 12:18 (id: 926012018)

18“Son of man, eat your bread with trembling, and drink your water with shaking and worry.


## Ezekiel 12:19 (id: 926012019)

19Then say to the people of the land, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the land of Israel, “They will eat their bread with trembling and drink their water while shaking, since the land will be despoiled of its fullness because of the violence of all those who live there.


## Ezekiel 12:20 (id: 926012020)

20So the cities that were inhabited will be desolate, and the land will become a wasteland; so you will know that I am Yahweh.”’”


## Ezekiel 12:21 (id: 926012021)

21Again the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 12:22 (id: 926012022)

22“Son of man, what is this proverb that you have in the land of Israel that says, ‘The days are prolonged, and every vision fails’?


## Ezekiel 12:23 (id: 926012023)

23Therefore, say to them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: I will put an end to this proverb, and the people of Israel will no longer use it.’ Say to them, ‘The days have drawn near when every vision will be fulfilled.


## Ezekiel 12:24 (id: 926012024)

24For there will no longer be any false visions or favorable divinations within the house of Israel.


## Ezekiel 12:25 (id: 926012025)

25For I am Yahweh! I speak, and I carry out the words that I speak. The matter will no longer be delayed. For I will speak this word in your days, rebellious house, and I will carry it out!—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.’”


## Ezekiel 12:26 (id: 926012026)

26Again the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 12:27 (id: 926012027)

27“Son of man! Behold, the house of Israel has said, ‘The vision that he sees is for many days from now, and he prophesies of far off times.’


## Ezekiel 12:28 (id: 926012028)

28Therefore say to them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: My words will not be delayed any longer, but the word that I have spoken will be done—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.’”


## Ezekiel 13:1 (id: 926013001)

1Again, the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 13:2 (id: 926013002)

2“Son of man, prophesy against the prophets who are prophesying in Israel, and say to those who are prophesying out of their own imaginations, ‘Listen to the word of Yahweh.


## Ezekiel 13:3 (id: 926013003)

3The Lord Yahweh says this: Woe to the foolish prophets who follow their own spirit, but who have seen nothing!


## Ezekiel 13:4 (id: 926013004)

4Israel, your prophets have been like jackals in the wastelands.


## Ezekiel 13:5 (id: 926013005)

5You have not gone to the breaks in the wall around the house of Israel in order to repair it, in order to resist in battle on the day of Yahweh.


## Ezekiel 13:6 (id: 926013006)

6The people have false visions and make false predictions, those who say, “Such and such is Yahweh’s declaration.” Yahweh has not sent them, but they nevertheless have made people hope that their messages would come true.


## Ezekiel 13:7 (id: 926013007)

7Have you not had false visions and made false predictions, you who say, “Such and such is Yahweh’s declaration” when I myself have not spoken?’


## Ezekiel 13:8 (id: 926013008)

8Therefore the Lord Yahweh says this, ‘Because you have had false visions and have told lies—therefore this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration against you:


## Ezekiel 13:9 (id: 926013009)

9My hand will be against the prophets who have lying visions and who make false predictions. They will not be in the assembly of my people, or enrolled in the record of the house of Israel; they must not go to the land of Israel. For you will know that I am the Lord Yahweh!


## Ezekiel 13:10 (id: 926013010)

10Because of this, and because they led my people astray and said, “Peace!” when there is no peace, they are building a wall that they will paint with whitewash.’


## Ezekiel 13:11 (id: 926013011)

11Say to those who are whitewashing the wall, ‘It will fall down; there will be a downpour of rain, and I will send hailstones to make it fall down, and a windstorm wind to break it down.


## Ezekiel 13:12 (id: 926013012)

12See, the wall will fall down. Have others not said to you, “Where is the whitewash that you put on it?”


## Ezekiel 13:13 (id: 926013013)

13Therefore the Lord Yahweh says this: I will bring a windstorm in my rage, and there will be floods of rain in my wrath! Hailstones in my rage will completely destroy it.


## Ezekiel 13:14 (id: 926013014)

14For I will tear down the wall that you have covered with whitewash, and I will demolish it to the ground and lay bare its foundations. So it will fall, and you will be annihilated in the middle of it all. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.


## Ezekiel 13:15 (id: 926013015)

15For I will annihilate in my fury the wall and those who whitewashed it. I will say to you, “The wall exists no more, nor do the people who whitewashed it—


## Ezekiel 13:16 (id: 926013016)

16the prophets of Israel who prophesied about Jerusalem and who had visions of peace for her. But there is no peace!—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.”’


## Ezekiel 13:17 (id: 926013017)

17So you, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people who prophesy out of their own minds, and prophesy against them.


## Ezekiel 13:18 (id: 926013018)

18Say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Woe to the women who sew magic charms onto every part of their hand and make veils for their heads of every size, used to hunt down people. Will you hunt down my people but save your own lives?


## Ezekiel 13:19 (id: 926013019)

19You have profaned me among my people for handfuls of barley and crumbs of bread, to kill people who should not die, and to preserve the lives of those who should not continue to live, because of your lies to my people who heard you.


## Ezekiel 13:20 (id: 926013020)

20Therefore the Lord Yahweh says this: I am against the magic charms that you have used to ensnare the people’s lives as if they were birds. Indeed, I will tear them from your arms; and the people whom you have trapped like birds—I will let them go free.


## Ezekiel 13:21 (id: 926013021)

21I will tear away your veils and rescue my people from your hand, so they will no longer be trapped in your hands. You will know that I am Yahweh.


## Ezekiel 13:22 (id: 926013022)

22Because you discourage the heart of the righteous person with lies, even though I did not desire his discouragement, and because you encourage instead the actions of the wicked person so that he will not turn from his way to save his life—


## Ezekiel 13:23 (id: 926013023)

23therefore you will no longer have false visions or continue to make predictions, for I will rescue my people out of your hand. You will know that I am Yahweh.’”


## Ezekiel 14:1 (id: 926014001)

1Some of the elders of Israel came to me and sat before me.


## Ezekiel 14:2 (id: 926014002)

2Then the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 14:3 (id: 926014003)

3“Son of man, these men have taken their idols into their hearts and have put the stumbling block of their iniquity before their own faces. Should I be inquired of at all by them?


## Ezekiel 14:4 (id: 926014004)

4Therefore announce this to them and say to them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Every man of the house of Israel who takes his idols into his heart, or who puts the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and who then comes to a prophet—I, Yahweh, will answer him according to the number of his idols.


## Ezekiel 14:5 (id: 926014005)

5I will do this so that I may take back the house of Israel in their hearts that have been driven far from me through their idols.’


## Ezekiel 14:6 (id: 926014006)

6Therefore say to the house of Israel, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Repent and turn away from your idols! Turn back your faces from all your abominations.


## Ezekiel 14:7 (id: 926014007)

7For every one from the house of Israel and every one of the foreigners staying in Israel who deserts me, who takes his idols into his heart and puts the stumbling block of his iniquity before his own face, and who then comes to a prophet to seek me—I, Yahweh, will answer him myself.


## Ezekiel 14:8 (id: 926014008)

8So I will set my face against that man and make him a sign and a proverb, for I will cut him off from the midst of my people, and you will know that I am Yahweh.


## Ezekiel 14:9 (id: 926014009)

9If a prophet is deceived and speaks a message, then I, Yahweh, will deceive that prophet; I will reach out with my hand against him and destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.


## Ezekiel 14:10 (id: 926014010)

10They will carry their own iniquity; the iniquity of the prophet will be the same as the iniquity of the one who inquires from him.


## Ezekiel 14:11 (id: 926014011)

11Because of this, the house of Israel will no longer wander away from following me nor defile themselves any longer through all their transgressions. They will be my people, and I will be their God—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.’”


## Ezekiel 14:12 (id: 926014012)

12Then the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 14:13 (id: 926014013)

13“Son of man, when a land sins against me by committing a sin so that I reach out with my hand against it and break the staff of its bread, and send out over it a famine and cut off both man and beast from the land;


## Ezekiel 14:14 (id: 926014014)

14then even if these three men—Noah, Daniel, and Job—were in the land’s midst, they could only rescue their own lives by their righteousness—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.


## Ezekiel 14:15 (id: 926014015)

15If I send evil beasts through the land and make it barren so that it becomes a wasteland where no man may pass through because of the beasts,


## Ezekiel 14:16 (id: 926014016)

16then even if these same three men were in it—as I live, declares the Lord Yahweh—they would not be able to rescue even their own sons or daughters; only their own lives would be rescued, but the land would become a wasteland.


## Ezekiel 14:17 (id: 926014017)

17Or if I bring a sword against that land and say, ‘Sword, go through the land and cut off both man and beast from it’,


## Ezekiel 14:18 (id: 926014018)

18then even if these three men were in the midst of the land—as I live, declares the Lord Yahweh—they would not be able to rescue even their own sons or daughters; only their own lives would be rescued.


## Ezekiel 14:19 (id: 926014019)

19Or if I send a plague against this land and pour out my fury against it through bloodshed, in order to cut off both man and beast,


## Ezekiel 14:20 (id: 926014020)

20then even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were in that land—as I live, declares the Lord Yahweh—they would not be able to rescue even their own sons or daughters; only their own lives would be rescued by their righteousness.


## Ezekiel 14:21 (id: 926014021)

21For the Lord Yahweh says this: I will certainly make things worse by sending my four punishments—famine, sword, wild animals, and plague—against Jerusalem to cut off both man and beast from her.


## Ezekiel 14:22 (id: 926014022)

22Yet, behold! A remnant will be left in her, survivors who will go out with sons and daughters. Behold! They will go out to you, and you will see their ways and actions and be comforted concerning the punishment that I have sent to Jerusalem, and about everything else that I have sent against the land.


## Ezekiel 14:23 (id: 926014023)

23The survivors will comfort you when you see their ways and their actions, so you will know all these things I have done against her, that I have not done them in vain!—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.”


## Ezekiel 15:1 (id: 926015001)

1Then the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 15:2 (id: 926015002)

2“Son of man, how is a vine better than any tree with branches that is among the trees in a forest?


## Ezekiel 15:3 (id: 926015003)

3Do people take wood from a vine to make anything? Or do they make a peg from it to hang anything on it?


## Ezekiel 15:4 (id: 926015004)

4See! If it is thrown into a fire as fuel, and if the fire has burned both of its ends and also the middle, is it good for anything?


## Ezekiel 15:5 (id: 926015005)

5See! When it was complete, it could not make anything; surely then, when the fire has burned, then it still will not make anything useful.


## Ezekiel 15:6 (id: 926015006)

6Therefore the Lord Yahweh says this: Unlike the trees in the forests, I have given the vine as fuel for fires; I will act in the same way toward the inhabitants of Jerusalem.


## Ezekiel 15:7 (id: 926015007)

7For I will set my face against them. Though they come out from the fire, yet the fire will consume them; so you will know that I am Yahweh, when I set my face against them.


## Ezekiel 15:8 (id: 926015008)

8Then I will make the land into an abandoned wasteland because they have committed sin—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.”


## Ezekiel 16:1 (id: 926016001)

1Then the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 16:2 (id: 926016002)

2“Son of man, inform Jerusalem about her abominations,


## Ezekiel 16:3 (id: 926016003)

3and declare, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this to Jerusalem: Your beginning and your birth took place in the land of Canaan; your father was an Amorite, and your mother was a Hittite.


## Ezekiel 16:4 (id: 926016004)

4On the day of your birth, your mother did not cut your navel, nor did she purify you in water or rub you down with salt, or wrap cloth around you.


## Ezekiel 16:5 (id: 926016005)

5No eye had compassion for you to do any of these things for you, to be compassionate toward you. On the day that you were born, with loathing for your life, you were thrown out into the open field.


## Ezekiel 16:6 (id: 926016006)

6But I passed by you, and I saw you writhing in your own blood; so I said to you in your blood, “Live!” I said to you in your blood, “Live!”


## Ezekiel 16:7 (id: 926016007)

7I made you grow like a plant in a field. You multiplied and became great, and you became the jewel of jewels. Your breasts became firm, and your hair grew thick, though you had been naked and bare.


## Ezekiel 16:8 (id: 926016008)

8I passed by you again, and I saw you. See! the time of love came for you, so I spread my robe over you and covered your nakedness. Then I swore to you and brought you into a covenant—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration—and you became mine.


## Ezekiel 16:9 (id: 926016009)

9So I washed you with water and rinsed your blood off you, and I anointed you with oil.


## Ezekiel 16:10 (id: 926016010)

10I dressed you in embroidered clothes and placed leather sandals on your feet. I wrapped you with fine linen and covered you with silk.


## Ezekiel 16:11 (id: 926016011)

11Next I adorned you with jewelry, and I put bracelets on your hands, and a chain around your neck.


## Ezekiel 16:12 (id: 926016012)

12I put a nose ring in your nostrils and earrings in your ears, and a beautiful crown on your head.


## Ezekiel 16:13 (id: 926016013)

13So you were adorned with gold and silver, and you were dressed in fine linen, silk, and embroidered clothes; you ate fine flour, honey, and oil, and you were very beautiful, and you became a queen.


## Ezekiel 16:14 (id: 926016014)

14Your fame went out among the nations because of your beauty, for it was perfect in the majesty that I had given to you—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.


## Ezekiel 16:15 (id: 926016015)

15But you trusted in your own beauty, and you acted like a prostitute because of your fame; you poured out your acts of prostitution on everyone who passed by, so that your beauty became his.


## Ezekiel 16:16 (id: 926016016)

16Then you took your clothes and with them you made high places for yourself decorated in various colors, and there you acted like a prostitute. This should not have happened. Nor should such a thing exist.


## Ezekiel 16:17 (id: 926016017)

17You took the fine jewels of the gold and silver that I gave you, and you made for yourself male figures, and you did with them as a prostitute would do.


## Ezekiel 16:18 (id: 926016018)

18You took your embroidered garments and covered them, and you set my oils and perfumes before them.


## Ezekiel 16:19 (id: 926016019)

19My bread I gave you—made with fine flour, oil, and honey—you set before them for a fragrant aroma, for this is what happened—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.


## Ezekiel 16:20 (id: 926016020)

20Then you took your sons and daughters whom you bore for me, and you sacrificed them to the images to be devoured as food. Are your acts of prostitution a small matter?


## Ezekiel 16:21 (id: 926016021)

21You slaughtered my children to the idols and made them pass through the fire.


## Ezekiel 16:22 (id: 926016022)

22In all your abominations and your acts of prostitution you have not thought about the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare as you thrashed about in your blood.


## Ezekiel 16:23 (id: 926016023)

23Woe! Woe to you!—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration—therefore, in addition to all this wickedness,


## Ezekiel 16:24 (id: 926016024)

24you built yourself a mound and made yourself a lofty shrine in every public place.


## Ezekiel 16:25 (id: 926016025)

25You built your high place at the head of every road and made your beauty a disgrace, and you spread your legs to anyone who passed by, and you multiplied your acts of prostitution.


## Ezekiel 16:26 (id: 926016026)

26You have acted like a prostitute with the Egyptians, your lustful neighbors, and you committed many more acts of prostitution, provoking me to anger.


## Ezekiel 16:27 (id: 926016027)

27See! I will strike you with my hand and cut off your food. I will hand your life over to your enemies, the daughters of the Philistines, who were ashamed of your obscene behavior.


## Ezekiel 16:28 (id: 926016028)

28You have acted like a prostitute with the Assyrians because you could not be satisfied. You acted like a prostitute and still were not satisfied.


## Ezekiel 16:29 (id: 926016029)

29You performed many more acts of prostitution in the land of the merchants of Chaldea, and even this did not satisfy you.


## Ezekiel 16:30 (id: 926016030)

30How sick is your heart—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration—that you would do all these things, deeds of a shameless prostitute?


## Ezekiel 16:31 (id: 926016031)

31You have built your mounds at the head of every street and made your lofty shrines in every public square. Yet you were not like a prostitute because you scoffed at taking payment.


## Ezekiel 16:32 (id: 926016032)

32You adulterous woman, you accept strangers instead of your husband.


## Ezekiel 16:33 (id: 926016033)

33People give payment to every prostitute, but you give your wages to all your lovers and bribe them to come to you from all around for your acts of prostitution.


## Ezekiel 16:34 (id: 926016034)

34So there is a difference between you and other women. No one offers payment for you to act as a prostitute. You are the very opposite. You gave them payment and none was given to you.


## Ezekiel 16:35 (id: 926016035)

35Therefore, you prostitute, listen to the word of Yahweh.


## Ezekiel 16:36 (id: 926016036)

36The Lord Yahweh says this: Because you have poured out your lust and uncovered your nakedness through your acts of prostitution with your lovers and with all your detestable idols, and because you gave them your children’s blood,


## Ezekiel 16:37 (id: 926016037)

37therefore, behold, I will gather all your lovers that you have met, all those whom you loved and all those whom you hated, and I will gather them against you on every side. I will uncover your nakedness to them so they see all your nakedness.


## Ezekiel 16:38 (id: 926016038)

38For I will punish you for adultery and the shedding of blood, and I will bring on you the bloodshed of my anger and passion.


## Ezekiel 16:39 (id: 926016039)

39I will give you into their hands so they will throw down your vaulted chamber and break down your high places and they will strip you of your clothes and take all of your jewelry. They will leave you naked and bare.


## Ezekiel 16:40 (id: 926016040)

40Then they will bring up a crowd against you and stone you with stones, and they will cut you apart with their swords.


## Ezekiel 16:41 (id: 926016041)

41They will burn your houses and will perform many acts of punishment on you in the sight of many women, for I will put a stop to your prostitution, and you will no longer pay your lovers.


## Ezekiel 16:42 (id: 926016042)

42Then I will calm my fury against you; my anger will leave you, for I will be satisfied, and will no longer be angry.


## Ezekiel 16:43 (id: 926016043)

43Because you did not call to mind the days of your youth and have made me shake with anger because of all these things, therefore, behold! I myself will bring down on your own head the punishment for what you have done—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration. Have you not added prostitution to all your other detestable practices?


## Ezekiel 16:44 (id: 926016044)

44Behold! Everyone who speaks proverbs concerning you will say, “As the mother is, so also is her daughter.”


## Ezekiel 16:45 (id: 926016045)

45You are the daughter of your mother, who detested her husband and her children, and you are the sister of your sisters who detested their husbands and their children. Your mother was a Hittite, and your father was an Amorite.


## Ezekiel 16:46 (id: 926016046)

46Your older sister was Samaria and her daughters were the ones living in the north, while your younger sister was the one living south of you, that is, Sodom and her daughters.


## Ezekiel 16:47 (id: 926016047)

47You not only walked in their ways and copied their behavior and practices, but in all your ways you have been worse than they were.


## Ezekiel 16:48 (id: 926016048)

48As I live—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration—your sister Sodom and her daughters, have not done as much evil as you and your daughters have done.


## Ezekiel 16:49 (id: 926016049)

49Behold! This was the sin of your sister Sodom that she was arrogant in her leisure, careless and unconcerned about anything. She did not strengthen the hands of the poor and needy people.


## Ezekiel 16:50 (id: 926016050)

50She was arrogant and committed disgusting actions before me, so I took them away just as you have seen.


## Ezekiel 16:51 (id: 926016051)

51Neither did Samaria commit even half of your sins; instead, you have done many more disgusting things than they did, and you have shown that your sisters were better than you because of all the disgusting things that you do!


## Ezekiel 16:52 (id: 926016052)

52Especially you, show your own shame; in this way you have shown that your sisters were better than you, because of the sins you committed in all those disgusting ways. Your sisters now seem better than you. Especially you, show your own shame, for in this way you have shown that your sisters were better than you.


## Ezekiel 16:53 (id: 926016053)

53For I will restore their fortunes—the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters, and the fortunes of Samaria and her daughters; but your fortunes will be among them.


## Ezekiel 16:54 (id: 926016054)

54On account of these things you will show your shame; you will be humiliated because of everything that you have done, and in this way you will be a comfort to them.


## Ezekiel 16:55 (id: 926016055)

55So your sister Sodom and her daughters will be restored to their former condition, and Samaria and her daughters will be restored to their former estate. Then you and your daughters will be restored to your former condition.


## Ezekiel 16:56 (id: 926016056)

56Sodom your sister was not even mentioned by your mouth in the days when you were proud,


## Ezekiel 16:57 (id: 926016057)

57before your wickedness was revealed. But now you are an object of scorn to the daughters of Edom and to all the daughters of the Philistines around her. People all about despise you.


## Ezekiel 16:58 (id: 926016058)

58You will show your shame and your disgusting actions!—this is Yahweh’s declaration!


## Ezekiel 16:59 (id: 926016059)

59The Lord Yahweh says this: I will deal with you as you deserve, you who have despised your oath by breaking the covenant.


## Ezekiel 16:60 (id: 926016060)

60But I myself will call to mind my covenant with you made in the days of your youth, and I will establish an everlasting covenant with you.


## Ezekiel 16:61 (id: 926016061)

61Then you will call to mind your ways and be ashamed when you receive your older sisters and your younger sisters. I will give them to you as daughters, but not because of your covenant.


## Ezekiel 16:62 (id: 926016062)

62I myself will establish my covenant with you, and you will know that I am Yahweh.


## Ezekiel 16:63 (id: 926016063)

63Because of these things, you will call everything to mind and be ashamed, so you will no longer open your mouth to speak because of your shame, when I have forgiven you for all that you have done—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.’”


## Ezekiel 17:1 (id: 926017001)

1The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 17:2 (id: 926017002)

2“Son of man, present a riddle and speak a parable to the house of Israel.


## Ezekiel 17:3 (id: 926017003)

3Say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: A large eagle with large wings and long pinions, full of feathers, and that was multicolored went to Lebanon and took hold of the top of a cedar tree.


## Ezekiel 17:4 (id: 926017004)

4It broke off the tips of the branches and took them to the land of Canaan; he planted it in a city of merchants.


## Ezekiel 17:5 (id: 926017005)

5He also took some seed of the land and planted it in fertile soil. He placed it beside a large body of water like a willow.


## Ezekiel 17:6 (id: 926017006)

6Then it sprouted and became a spreading vine low to the ground. Its branches turned toward him, and its roots grew under it. So it became a vine and produced branches and sent out shoots.


## Ezekiel 17:7 (id: 926017007)

7But there was another great eagle with large wings and many feathers. Behold! This vine turned its roots toward the eagle, and it spread out its branches toward the eagle from the place it had been planted so it would be watered.


## Ezekiel 17:8 (id: 926017008)

8It had been planted in good soil beside a large body of water so it would produce branches and sprout fruit, to become a magnificent vine.’


## Ezekiel 17:9 (id: 926017009)

9Say to the people, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Will it prosper? Will it not be uprooted and stripped of its fruit so that it withers, and all its fresh growth will wither? No strong arm or many people will be needed to pull it out by its roots.


## Ezekiel 17:10 (id: 926017010)

10So behold! After it has been planted, will it grow? Will it not wither when the eastern wind touches it? It will completely wither away in the garden plot where it sprouted.’”


## Ezekiel 17:11 (id: 926017011)

11Then the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 17:12 (id: 926017012)

12“Speak to the rebellious house, ‘Do you not know what these things mean? Behold! The king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and took her king and her princes and brought them to him in Babylon.


## Ezekiel 17:13 (id: 926017013)

13Then he took a royal descendant, made a covenant with him, and brought him under an oath. He took away the powerful people of the land,


## Ezekiel 17:14 (id: 926017014)

14so the kingdom might become lowly and not lift itself up. By keeping his covenant the land will survive.


## Ezekiel 17:15 (id: 926017015)

15But the king of Jerusalem rebelled against him by sending his ambassadors to Egypt to acquire horses and an army. Will he succeed? Will the one doing these things escape? If he breaks the covenant, will he escape?


## Ezekiel 17:16 (id: 926017016)

16As I live!—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration—he will surely die in the land of the king who made him king, the king whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he broke. He will die in the middle of Babylon.


## Ezekiel 17:17 (id: 926017017)

17Pharaoh with his mighty army and a great company of men will not help him in battle, when ramps are constructed and siege walls are built up to cut off many lives.


## Ezekiel 17:18 (id: 926017018)

18For the king despised his oath by breaking the covenant. Behold, he reached out with his hand to make a promise and yet he did all these things. He will not escape.


## Ezekiel 17:19 (id: 926017019)

19Therefore the Lord Yahweh says this: As I live, was it not my oath that he despised and my covenant that he broke? So I will bring his punishment on his head!


## Ezekiel 17:20 (id: 926017020)

20I will spread my net out over him, and he will be caught in my hunting net. Then I will bring him to Babylon and execute judgment on him there for his treason that he committed when he betrayed me!


## Ezekiel 17:21 (id: 926017021)

21All of his refugees in his armies will fall by the sword, and the ones who remain will be scattered in every direction. Then you will know that I am Yahweh; I have declared this would happen.”


## Ezekiel 17:22 (id: 926017022)

22The Lord Yahweh says this, ‘So I myself will take away the highest part of the cedar tree, and I will plant it away from its tender branches. I will break it off, and I myself will plant it on a high mountain.


## Ezekiel 17:23 (id: 926017023)

23I will plant it on the mountains of Israel so it will bear branches and produce fruit, and it will become a majestic cedar so that every winged bird will live under it. They will nest in the shade of its branches.


## Ezekiel 17:24 (id: 926017024)

24Then all the trees of the field will know that I am Yahweh. I bring down the high trees and I raise up the low trees. I wither the watered tree and I cause the dried tree to bloom. I am Yahweh, I have declared that this will happen; and I have done it.’”


## Ezekiel 18:1 (id: 926018001)

1The word of Yahweh came to me again, saying,


## Ezekiel 18:2 (id: 926018002)

2“What do you mean, you who use this proverb concerning the land of Israel and say, ‘Fathers eat sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are made blunt’?


## Ezekiel 18:3 (id: 926018003)

3As I live—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration—there will certainly no longer be any occasion for you to use this proverb in Israel.


## Ezekiel 18:4 (id: 926018004)

4Behold! Every life belongs to me—the life of the father as well as the life of the son, they belong to me! The soul who sins is the one who will die!


## Ezekiel 18:5 (id: 926018005)

5What can be said about a man who is righteous and who carries out justice and righteousness—


## Ezekiel 18:6 (id: 926018006)

6if he does not eat upon the mountains or lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, and he does not defile his neighbor’s wife, nor approached a woman during her monthly period, is he a righteous man?


## Ezekiel 18:7 (id: 926018007)

7What can be said about a man who does not oppress anyone, and he gives back to the debtor what was put up as security for a loan, and he does not commit theft but gives his food to the hungry and he covers the naked with clothes, is he a righteous man?


## Ezekiel 18:8 (id: 926018008)

8What can be said about a man who does not charge too much interest for the money he loans, and he does not take too much profit for what he sells? It is said of him that he carries out justice and establishes faithfulness between people.


## Ezekiel 18:9 (id: 926018009)

9If that man walks in my statutes and keeps my decrees to act faithfully, then the promise for this righteous man is this: He will surely live!—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.


## Ezekiel 18:10 (id: 926018010)

10But suppose that he has a violent son who sheds blood and does any one of these things that were mentioned,


## Ezekiel 18:11 (id: 926018011)

11(though his father has not done any of these things). He eats upon the mountains and he defiles his neighbor’s wife, what can be said about him?


## Ezekiel 18:12 (id: 926018012)

12This man oppresses the poor and needy, and he seizes and robs, and he does not return a pledge, and he lifts up his eyes to the idols and commits disgusting actions,


## Ezekiel 18:13 (id: 926018013)

13and he lends out money at too high interest and he makes too much profit on what he sells, should that man live? Surely he will not! He will certainly die and his blood will be on him because he has done all these detestable things.


## Ezekiel 18:14 (id: 926018014)

14But behold! Suppose there is a man who bears a son, and his son sees all the sins that his father has committed, and though he sees them, he does not do those things.


## Ezekiel 18:15 (id: 926018015)

15That son does not eat upon the mountains, and he does not lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, and he does not defile his neighbor’s wife, what can be said about him?


## Ezekiel 18:16 (id: 926018016)

16That son does not oppress anyone, or seize a pledge, or take stolen things, but instead gives his food to the hungry and covers up the naked with clothes.


## Ezekiel 18:17 (id: 926018017)

17That son does not oppress anyone or take interest that is too high or make too much profit for a loan, but he carries out my decrees and walks according to my statutes; that son will not die for his father’s sin: He will surely live!


## Ezekiel 18:18 (id: 926018018)

18His father, since he oppressed others by extortion and robbed his brother, and did what is not good among his people—behold, he will die in his iniquity.


## Ezekiel 18:19 (id: 926018019)

19But you say, ‘Why does the son not bear the iniquity of his father?’ Because the son carries out justice and righteousness and keeps all my statutes; he does them. He will surely live!


## Ezekiel 18:20 (id: 926018020)

20The one who sins, he is the one who will die. A son will not bear his father’s iniquity, and a father will not bear his son’s iniquity. The righteousness of the one who acts rightly will be on himself, and the wickedness of the wicked will be on himself.


## Ezekiel 18:21 (id: 926018021)

21But if the wicked turns away from all his sins that he has done, and keeps all my statutes and performs justice and righteousness, then he will certainly live and not die.


## Ezekiel 18:22 (id: 926018022)

22All the transgressions that he has committed will not be called to mind against him. He will live by the righteousness that he practices.


## Ezekiel 18:23 (id: 926018023)

23Do I greatly rejoice over the death of the wicked—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration—and not in his turning away from his way so that he may live?


## Ezekiel 18:24 (id: 926018024)

24But if the righteous person turns away from his righteousness and commits iniquity and practices abominations like all the abominations that the wicked person does, then will he live? All the righteousness that he had done will not be called to mind when he betrays me in his treason. So he will die in the sins that he committed.


## Ezekiel 18:25 (id: 926018025)

25But you say, ‘The way of the Lord is not fair!’ Listen, house of Israel! Are my ways unfair? Is it not your ways that are unfair?


## Ezekiel 18:26 (id: 926018026)

26When the righteous man turns away from his righteousness, and commits iniquity and dies because of them, then he will die in the iniquity that he has done.


## Ezekiel 18:27 (id: 926018027)

27But when a wicked man turns away from his wickedness that he has done and performs justice and righteousness, then he will preserve his life.


## Ezekiel 18:28 (id: 926018028)

28For he has seen and turned away from all the transgressions that he had done. He will surely live, and he will not die.


## Ezekiel 18:29 (id: 926018029)

29But the house of Israel says, ‘The way of the Lord is not fair!’ How is my way not fair, house of Israel? It is your ways that are not fair.


## Ezekiel 18:30 (id: 926018030)

30Therefore I will judge each man among you according to his ways, house of Israel!—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration. Repent and turn away from all your transgressions so that they will not be stumbling blocks of iniquity against you.


## Ezekiel 18:31 (id: 926018031)

31Throw away from yourselves all of the transgressions that you have committed; make for yourselves a new heart and a new spirit. Why should you die, house of Israel?


## Ezekiel 18:32 (id: 926018032)

32For I have no delight in the death of the one who dies—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration—so repent and live!”


## Ezekiel 19:1 (id: 926019001)

1“Now you, take up a lamentation against the leaders of Israel


## Ezekiel 19:2 (id: 926019002)

2and say, ‘Who was your mother? A lioness, she lived with a lion’s son; in the midst of young lions, she nurtured her cubs.


## Ezekiel 19:3 (id: 926019003)

3She is the one who raised up one of her cubs to become a young lion, a lion who learned to tear apart his victims, and then he devoured men.


## Ezekiel 19:4 (id: 926019004)

4Then the nations heard about him. He was caught in their trap, and they brought him with hooks to the land of Egypt.


## Ezekiel 19:5 (id: 926019005)

5Then she saw that although she had waited for his return, her expectation was now gone, so she took another of her cubs and raised him to become a young lion.


## Ezekiel 19:6 (id: 926019006)

6This young lion roamed about in the midst of lions. He was a young lion and learned to tear his victims; he devoured men.


## Ezekiel 19:7 (id: 926019007)

7He seized their widows and ruined their cities. The land and its fullness were abandoned because of the sound of his roaring.


## Ezekiel 19:8 (id: 926019008)

8But the nations came against him from the surrounding provinces; they spread their nets over him. He was caught in their trap.


## Ezekiel 19:9 (id: 926019009)

9With hooks they put him in a cage and then they brought him to the king of Babylon. They brought him to the strongholds so that his voice would no longer be heard on the mountains of Israel.


## Ezekiel 19:10 (id: 926019010)

10Your mother was like a vine planted in your blood beside the water. it was fruitful and full of branches because of the abundance of water.


## Ezekiel 19:11 (id: 926019011)

11It had strong branches that were used for rulers’ scepters, and its size was exalted above the branches, and its height was seen by the greatness of its foliage.


## Ezekiel 19:12 (id: 926019012)

12But the vine was uprooted in fury and thrown down to the earth, and an eastern wind dried out its fruit. Its strong branches were broken off and withered and fire consumed them.


## Ezekiel 19:13 (id: 926019013)

13So now it is planted in the wilderness, in a land of drought and thirst.


## Ezekiel 19:14 (id: 926019014)

14For fire went out from her large branches and consumed its fruit. There is no strong branch on it, no scepter to rule.’ This is a lamentation and will be sung as a lamentation.”


## Ezekiel 20:1 (id: 926020001)

1It came about in the seventh year, on the tenth day of the fifth month, that elders of Israel came to inquire of Yahweh and sat before me.


## Ezekiel 20:2 (id: 926020002)

2Then the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 20:3 (id: 926020003)

3“Son of man, declare to the elders of Israel and say to them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Have you come to inquire of me? As I live, I will not be inquired of by you!—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.’


## Ezekiel 20:4 (id: 926020004)

4Will you judge them? Will you judge, son of man? Let them know about their fathers’ abominations.


## Ezekiel 20:5 (id: 926020005)

5Say to them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: On the day that I chose Israel and raised my hand to swear an oath to the descendants of the house of Jacob, and made myself known to them in the land of Egypt, when I raised my hand to swear an oath to them. I said, “I am Yahweh your God”—


## Ezekiel 20:6 (id: 926020006)

6on that day I raised my hand to swear an oath to them that I would bring them out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had carefully selected for them. It was flowing with milk and honey; it was the most beautiful ornament among all the lands.


## Ezekiel 20:7 (id: 926020007)

7I said to them, “Let each man throw away the detestable things from before his eyes and the idols of Egypt. Do not make yourselves unclean; I am Yahweh your God.”


## Ezekiel 20:8 (id: 926020008)

8But they rebelled against me and were unwilling to listen to me. Each man did not throw away the detestable things from before his eyes nor forsake the idols of Egypt, so I determined to pour out my fury upon them to satisfy my wrath among them in the middle of the land of Egypt.


## Ezekiel 20:9 (id: 926020009)

9I acted for my name’s sake so it would not be profaned in the eyes of the nations among whom they were staying. I made myself known to them, in their eyes, by bringing them out of the land of Egypt.


## Ezekiel 20:10 (id: 926020010)

10So I sent them out of the land of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness.


## Ezekiel 20:11 (id: 926020011)

11Then I gave them my statutes and made my decrees known to them, by which a man will live if he obeys them.


## Ezekiel 20:12 (id: 926020012)

12I also gave them my Sabbaths as a sign between myself and them, for them to know that I am Yahweh who makes them holy.


## Ezekiel 20:13 (id: 926020013)

13But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness. They did not walk in my statutes; instead, they rejected my decrees, by which a man will live if he obeys them. They greatly profaned my Sabbaths, so I said I would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderness in order to end them.


## Ezekiel 20:14 (id: 926020014)

14But I acted for my name’s sake so it would not be profaned in the eyes of the nations, in whose sight I had brought them out of Egypt.


## Ezekiel 20:15 (id: 926020015)

15So I myself also raised my hand to swear an oath to them in the wilderness not to bring them into the land that I had been going to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey, which was the most beautiful ornament among all the lands.


## Ezekiel 20:16 (id: 926020016)

16I swore this because they had rejected my decrees and did not walk in my statutes, and they profaned my Sabbaths, since their hearts walked after their idols.


## Ezekiel 20:17 (id: 926020017)

17But my eye spared them from their destruction and I did not annihilate them in the wilderness.


## Ezekiel 20:18 (id: 926020018)

18I said to their children in the wilderness, “Do not walk in the statutes of your fathers, or keep their rules, or defile yourselves with their idols.


## Ezekiel 20:19 (id: 926020019)

19I am Yahweh your God, walk in my statutes; keep my decrees and obey them.


## Ezekiel 20:20 (id: 926020020)

20Keep my Sabbaths holy so that they will be a sign between me and you, so that you will know that I am Yahweh your God.”


## Ezekiel 20:21 (id: 926020021)

21But their sons and daughters rebelled against me. They did not walk in my statutes or keep my decrees, by which a man might live if he obeys them. They profaned my Sabbaths, so I determined to pour out my fury upon them to satisfy my wrath against them in the wilderness.


## Ezekiel 20:22 (id: 926020022)

22But I turned my hand away and acted for my name’s sake, so it would not be profaned in the eyes of the nations in whose sight I had brought out the Israelites.


## Ezekiel 20:23 (id: 926020023)

23I myself also lifted up my hand to swear to them in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the nations and disperse them among the lands.


## Ezekiel 20:24 (id: 926020024)

24I decided to do this since they had not obeyed my decrees, and since they had rejected my statutes and profaned my Sabbaths. Their eyes were longing after their fathers’ idols.


## Ezekiel 20:25 (id: 926020025)

25Then I also gave them statutes that were not good, and decrees by which they could not live.


## Ezekiel 20:26 (id: 926020026)

26I declared them to be unclean through their gifts—they made a sacrifice of every firstborn of the womb and caused them to pass through the fire—that I might fill them with horror so they will know that I am Yahweh!’


## Ezekiel 20:27 (id: 926020027)

27Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel and say to them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: In this also your fathers blasphemed me when they were unfaithful to me.


## Ezekiel 20:28 (id: 926020028)

28When I brought them into the land that I had sworn to give them, and then whenever they saw any high hill and leafy tree, they offered their sacrifices, they provoked me by their offerings, and there they also burned their fragrant incense and poured out their drink offerings.


## Ezekiel 20:29 (id: 926020029)

29Then I said to them, “What is this high place where you bring offerings there?” So the name is called Bamah to this day.’


## Ezekiel 20:30 (id: 926020030)

30Therefore say to the house of Israel, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Why do you make yourselves unclean with the ways of your fathers? So why do you act like prostitutes, searching for disgusting things?


## Ezekiel 20:31 (id: 926020031)

31When you offer up your gifts—when you cause your sons to pass through the fire—to this day you defile yourselves with all your idols. So why should I let you seek me, house of Israel? As I live—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration—I will not allow you to seek me.


## Ezekiel 20:32 (id: 926020032)

32The thought that is forming in your mind will never happen. You say, “Let us be like the other nations, like the clans in the other lands who worship wood and stone.”


## Ezekiel 20:33 (id: 926020033)

33As I live—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration—I will certainly reign over you with a mighty hand, a raised arm, and fury that will be poured out on you.


## Ezekiel 20:34 (id: 926020034)

34I will bring you out from the other peoples and will gather you out of the countries among whom you have been scattered. I will do this with a mighty hand and with fury poured out.


## Ezekiel 20:35 (id: 926020035)

35Then I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, and there I will judge you face to face.


## Ezekiel 20:36 (id: 926020036)

36As I judged your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so also I will judge you—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.


## Ezekiel 20:37 (id: 926020037)

37I will cause you to pass under my rod, and I will make you obey the requirements of the covenant.


## Ezekiel 20:38 (id: 926020038)

38I will purge from among you the rebels and those who revolt against me. I will send them out from the land where they are staying as foreigners, but they will not enter the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.


## Ezekiel 20:39 (id: 926020039)

39So to you, house of Israel, the Lord Yahweh says this: Each of you should go to his own idols. Worship them if you will refuse to listen to me, but you must no longer profane my holy name with your gifts and your idols.


## Ezekiel 20:40 (id: 926020040)

40For on my holy mountain, on the mountain peak of Israel—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration—all of the house of Israel will worship me there in the land. I will be pleased to require your offerings there, and also the firstfruits of your tribute with all your holy things.


## Ezekiel 20:41 (id: 926020041)

41I will accept you like fragrant incense when I bring you out from the peoples and gather you out of the countries where you have been scattered. I will show myself as holy among you for the nations to see.


## Ezekiel 20:42 (id: 926020042)

42Then, when I bring you to the land of Israel, to the land that I have lifted up my hand to swear to give to your fathers, you will know that I am Yahweh.


## Ezekiel 20:43 (id: 926020043)

43There you will call to mind your conduct and all of your deeds by which you defiled yourselves, and you will despise yourselves in your own eyes for all your evil deeds that you have done.


## Ezekiel 20:44 (id: 926020044)

44So you will know that I am Yahweh when I do this to you because of my name’s sake, and not because of your evil deeds, and not because of your corrupt deeds, house of Israel—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.’”


## Ezekiel 20:45 (id: 926020045)

45Then the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 20:46 (id: 926020046)

46“Son of man, set your face toward the southern lands, and speak against the south; prophesy against the forest of the Negev.


## Ezekiel 20:47 (id: 926020047)

47Say to the forest of the Negev, ‘This is Yahweh’s declaration—the Lord Yahweh says this: See, I will set a fire among you. It will devour every fresh tree and every dried tree among you. The fiery flame will not be quenched; every face from the south to the north will be burned.


## Ezekiel 20:48 (id: 926020048)

48Then all flesh will see that I am Yahweh when I light the fire, and it will not be quenched.’”


## Ezekiel 20:49 (id: 926020049)

49Then I said, “Alas! Lord Yahweh, they are saying of me, ‘Is he not a mere teller of parables?’”


## Ezekiel 21:1 (id: 926021001)

1Then the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 21:2 (id: 926021002)

2“Son of man, set your face toward Jerusalem, and speak against the sanctuaries; prophesy against the land of Israel.


## Ezekiel 21:3 (id: 926021003)

3Say to the land of Israel, ‘Yahweh says this: Behold! I am against you! I will draw my sword from its sheath and cut off both the righteous person and the wicked person from you!


## Ezekiel 21:4 (id: 926021004)

4In order for me to cut off both the righteous and the wicked from you, my sword will go out from its sheath against all flesh from the south to the north.


## Ezekiel 21:5 (id: 926021005)

5Then all flesh will know that I, Yahweh, have drawn my sword from its sheath. It will no longer hold back!’


## Ezekiel 21:6 (id: 926021006)

6As for you, son of man, groan as your loins break! In bitterness groan before their eyes!


## Ezekiel 21:7 (id: 926021007)

7Then it will happen that they will ask you, ‘For what reason are you groaning?’ Then you will say, ‘Because of the news that is coming, for every heart will faint away, and every hand will falter! Every spirit will grow faint, and every knee will flow like water. Behold! It is coming and it will be like this!—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.’”


## Ezekiel 21:8 (id: 926021008)

8Then the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 21:9 (id: 926021009)

9“Son of man, prophesy and say, ‘The Lord says this: “Say: A sword! A sword! It will be sharpened and polished!


## Ezekiel 21:10 (id: 926021010)

10It will be sharpened in order to engage in great slaughter! It will be polished in order to be like lightning! Should we rejoice in my son’s scepter? The coming sword hates every such rod!


## Ezekiel 21:11 (id: 926021011)

11So the sword will be given to be polished, and then to be grasped by the hand! The sword is sharpened and it is polished and it is to be given into the hand of the one who kills!”’”


## Ezekiel 21:12 (id: 926021012)

12Call for help and lament, son of man! For that sword has come against my people! It is against all the leaders of Israel. They are thrown against the sword with my people. Therefore, slap your thigh!


## Ezekiel 21:13 (id: 926021013)

13For there is a trial, but what if the scepter does not last?—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.


## Ezekiel 21:14 (id: 926021014)

14Now you, son of man, prophesy and hit your two hands together, for the sword will attack even a third time! A sword for the ones to be slaughtered! It is a sword for the many to be slaughtered, piercing them everywhere!


## Ezekiel 21:15 (id: 926021015)

15In order to melt their hearts and to multiply their fallen, I have set the sword for slaughter at all their gates. Ah! It is made like lightning, it is grasped for slaughter.


## Ezekiel 21:16 (id: 926021016)

16You, sword! Strike to the right! Strike to the left! Go wherever your face is turned.


## Ezekiel 21:17 (id: 926021017)

17For I will also hit my two hands together, and then I will bring my fury to rest! I, Yahweh, declare it!”


## Ezekiel 21:18 (id: 926021018)

18The word of Yahweh came to me again, saying,


## Ezekiel 21:19 (id: 926021019)

19“Now you, son of man, assign two roads for the sword of the king of Babylon to come. The two roads will start in the same land, and a signpost will mark one of them as leading to a city.


## Ezekiel 21:20 (id: 926021020)

20Mark one road for the Babylonian army to come to Rabbah, the city of the Ammonites. Mark the other to lead the army to Judah and the city of Jerusalem, which is fortified.


## Ezekiel 21:21 (id: 926021021)

21For the king of Babylon will stop at the crossroads, at the junction, in order to practice divination. He will shake some arrows and ask direction from some idols and he will examine a liver.


## Ezekiel 21:22 (id: 926021022)

22In his right hand will be an omen about Jerusalem, to set battering rams against it, to open his mouth to order the slaughter, to sound a war cry, to set battering rams against the gates, to build a ramp, and to erect siege towers.


## Ezekiel 21:23 (id: 926021023)

23It will seem to be a useless omen in the eyes of the ones in Jerusalem, those who had sworn an oath to the Babylonians! But the king will accuse them of violating their treaty in order to besiege them!


## Ezekiel 21:24 (id: 926021024)

24Therefore the Lord Yahweh says this: Because you have made your guilt to be remembered, making your transgressions to be revealed, so that in all your actions your sins will be seen— because you have done this you will be taken in hand.


## Ezekiel 21:25 (id: 926021025)

25As for you, profane and wicked ruler of Israel, whose day of punishment has come, and whose time of committing iniquity has ended,


## Ezekiel 21:26 (id: 926021026)

26the Lord Yahweh says this to you: Remove the turban and take off the crown! Things will no longer be the same! Exalt the lowly and humble the exalted!


## Ezekiel 21:27 (id: 926021027)

27A ruin! A ruin! I will make it a ruin! It will not be restored until the one comes who is assigned to execute judgment.


## Ezekiel 21:28 (id: 926021028)

28So you, son of man, prophesy and say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this to the people of Ammon concerning their coming disgrace: A sword, a sword is drawn! It is sharpened for the slaughter in order to devour, so it will be like lightning!


## Ezekiel 21:29 (id: 926021029)

29While prophets see empty visions for you, while they perform rituals to come up with lies for you, this sword will lie on the necks of the wicked who are about to be killed, whose day of punishment has come and whose time of iniquity is about to end.


## Ezekiel 21:30 (id: 926021030)

30Return the sword to its sheath. In the place of your creation, in the land of your origin, I will judge you!


## Ezekiel 21:31 (id: 926021031)

31I will pour out my indignation on you! I will fan the fire of my rage against you and put you into the hand of cruel men, craftsmen of destruction!


## Ezekiel 21:32 (id: 926021032)

32You will become fuel for the fire! Your blood will be in the midst of the land. You will not be remembered, for I, Yahweh have declared this!’”


## Ezekiel 22:1 (id: 926022001)

1Then the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 22:2 (id: 926022002)

2“Now you, son of man, will you judge? Will you judge the city of blood? Make her know all her abominations.


## Ezekiel 22:3 (id: 926022003)

3You must say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: This is a city that pours out blood in her midst so that her time may come; a city that makes idols to make herself unclean.


## Ezekiel 22:4 (id: 926022004)

4You have become guilty by the blood that you have poured out, and you have become unclean by the idols that you have made. You have drawn your days to a close, and the end of your years has come. Therefore I will make you a reproach to the nations and a laughingstock to all the lands.


## Ezekiel 22:5 (id: 926022005)

5Both those who are near and those who are far away from you will mock you—you unclean city—with the reputation known everywhere as being full of confusion.


## Ezekiel 22:6 (id: 926022006)

6Behold! The rulers of Israel, each one by his own power, have come to you to pour out blood.


## Ezekiel 22:7 (id: 926022007)

7They have dishonored fathers and mothers within you, and they have performed oppression on the foreigners in your midst. They have mistreated the orphans and the widows within you.


## Ezekiel 22:8 (id: 926022008)

8You have despised my holy things and have profaned my Sabbaths.


## Ezekiel 22:9 (id: 926022009)

9Slanderous men have come within you in order to pour out blood, and they eat on the mountains. They perform wickedness in your midst.


## Ezekiel 22:10 (id: 926022010)

10Within you men uncover the nakedness of their father. Within you they have violated unclean women during their menstrual period.


## Ezekiel 22:11 (id: 926022011)

11Men who commit abominations with their neighbors’ wives, and men who make their own daughters\-in\-law shamefully unclean; men who abuse their own sisters—daughters of their own fathers—all these are done within you.


## Ezekiel 22:12 (id: 926022012)

12These men take bribes within you in order to pour out blood and you have taken interest and gained too much profit, and you have damaged your neighbors through oppression, and you have forgotten me—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.


## Ezekiel 22:13 (id: 926022013)

13See! With my hand I have struck the dishonest gain that you have made, and the bloodshed that is done in the midst of you.


## Ezekiel 22:14 (id: 926022014)

14Will your heart stand, will your hands be strong on the days when I myself will deal with you? I, Yahweh, am declaring this, and I will do it.


## Ezekiel 22:15 (id: 926022015)

15So I will scatter you among the nations and disperse you through the lands. In this way, I will purge your uncleanness from you.


## Ezekiel 22:16 (id: 926022016)

16So you will become unclean in the eyes of the nations. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.’”


## Ezekiel 22:17 (id: 926022017)

17Next the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 22:18 (id: 926022018)

18“Son of man, the house of Israel has become dross to me. All of them are the leftovers of bronze and tin, and iron and lead in the midst of you. They will be like the dross of silver in your furnace.


## Ezekiel 22:19 (id: 926022019)

19Therefore the Lord Yahweh says this, ‘Because all of you have become like dross, therefore, behold! I am about to gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.


## Ezekiel 22:20 (id: 926022020)

20As men gather silver, bronze, iron, lead and tin and put it inside a furnace to melt it, and they blow the fire on it in order to melt it, so I will gather you in my anger and my wrath, and I will put you there and melt you.


## Ezekiel 22:21 (id: 926022021)

21I will gather you and blow on you the fire of my wrath, and you will be melted in the midst of it.


## Ezekiel 22:22 (id: 926022022)

22As silver is melted in a furnace, you will be melted in it, and you will know that I, Yahweh, have poured out my wrath on you!’”


## Ezekiel 22:23 (id: 926022023)

23The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 22:24 (id: 926022024)

24“Son of man, say to her, ‘You are a land that has not been cleansed. There is no rain on the day of wrath!


## Ezekiel 22:25 (id: 926022025)

25There is a conspiracy of her prophets in her midst, like a roaring lion tearing apart a victim. They consume life and take precious wealth; they make many widows within her!


## Ezekiel 22:26 (id: 926022026)

26Her priests do violence to my law, and they profane my holy things. They do not distinguish between holy things and profane things, and do not teach the difference between the unclean and the clean. They hide their eyes from my Sabbaths so that I am profaned in their midst.


## Ezekiel 22:27 (id: 926022027)

27Her princes within her are like wolves tearing apart their victims. They pour out blood and destroy life, to make a profit dishonestly.


## Ezekiel 22:28 (id: 926022028)

28Her prophets have painted them over with whitewash; they see false visions and predict falsehoods to them. They say “The Lord Yahweh says this” when Yahweh has not spoken.


## Ezekiel 22:29 (id: 926022029)

29The people of the land have oppressed through extortion and plundered through robbery, and they mistreat the poor and needy, and oppress the foreigner without justice.


## Ezekiel 22:30 (id: 926022030)

30So I searched for a man from them who would build up a wall and who would stand before me in its breach for the land so I would not destroy it, but I found no one.


## Ezekiel 22:31 (id: 926022031)

31So I will pour out my indignation upon them. I will finish them with the fire of my indignation and set their way on their own heads—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.’”


## Ezekiel 23:1 (id: 926023001)

1The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 23:2 (id: 926023002)

2“Son of man, there were two women, daughters of the same mother.


## Ezekiel 23:3 (id: 926023003)

3They acted as prostitutes in Egypt in the time of their youth. They acted as prostitutes there. Their breasts were squeezed and their virgin nipples were fondled there.


## Ezekiel 23:4 (id: 926023004)

4Their names were Oholah—the older sister—and Oholibah—her younger sister. Then they became mine and bore sons and daughters. Their names mean this: Oholah means Samaria, and Oholibah means Jerusalem.


## Ezekiel 23:5 (id: 926023005)

5But Oholah acted as a prostitute even when she was mine; she lusted for her lovers, for the Assyrians who were dominant,


## Ezekiel 23:6 (id: 926023006)

6the governor who wore blue, and for his officials, who were strong and handsome, all of them men riding on horses.


## Ezekiel 23:7 (id: 926023007)

7So she gave herself as a prostitute to them, to all the best of Assyria’s men, and she made herself unclean with everyone she lusted for—and with all their idols.


## Ezekiel 23:8 (id: 926023008)

8For she had not left her prostitute behavior behind in Egypt, when they had lain with her when she had been a young girl, when they caressed her virgin bosom and poured out their lust upon her.


## Ezekiel 23:9 (id: 926023009)

9Therefore I gave her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians for whom she lusted.


## Ezekiel 23:10 (id: 926023010)

10They uncovered her nakedness, took her sons and daughters, killed her with the sword, and she became notorious among other women, so they executed judgment on her.


## Ezekiel 23:11 (id: 926023011)

11Her sister Oholibah saw this, but she lusted even more passionately and acted like a prostitute even more than her sister.


## Ezekiel 23:12 (id: 926023012)

12She lusted for the Assyrians, the governors and the dominating officials who dressed impressively, who were men riding horses. All of them were strong, handsome men.


## Ezekiel 23:13 (id: 926023013)

13I saw that she had made herself unclean. It was the same for both sisters.


## Ezekiel 23:14 (id: 926023014)

14Then she increased her prostitution even more. She saw men carved on walls, figures of Chaldeans painted in red,


## Ezekiel 23:15 (id: 926023015)

15wearing belts around their waists, with flowing turbans on their heads. All of them had the appearance of officers of chariot troops, the likeness of sons of Babylonia, whose native land is Chaldea.


## Ezekiel 23:16 (id: 926023016)

16As soon as her eyes saw them, she lusted for them, so she sent out messengers to them in Chaldea.


## Ezekiel 23:17 (id: 926023017)

17Then the Babylonians came to her and to her bed of lust, and they made her unclean with their promiscuousness. By what she had done she was made unclean, so she turned herself away from them in disgust.


## Ezekiel 23:18 (id: 926023018)

18When she displayed her acts of prostitution and uncovered her nakedness, I turned away from her, just as I had turned away in disgust from her sister.


## Ezekiel 23:19 (id: 926023019)

19Then she increased her prostitution as she remembered the days of her youth, when she was a prostitute in the land of Egypt.


## Ezekiel 23:20 (id: 926023020)

20So she lusted for her lovers, whose private parts were like those of donkeys, and whose reproductive emissions were like those of horses.


## Ezekiel 23:21 (id: 926023021)

21This is how you committed shameful acts of your youth, when the Egyptians fondled your nipples and squeezed your young breasts.


## Ezekiel 23:22 (id: 926023022)

22Therefore, Oholibah, the Lord Yahweh says this, ‘Behold! I will turn your lovers against you. Those from whom you turned away, I will bring them against you from every side:


## Ezekiel 23:23 (id: 926023023)

23the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, Shoa, and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them, strong, handsome men, governors and commanders, all of them are officers and men of reputation, all of them riding on horses.


## Ezekiel 23:24 (id: 926023024)

24They will come against you with weapons, and with chariots and wagons, and with a great crowd of people. They will set large shields, small shields, and helmets against you all around. I will give them the opportunity to punish you, and they will punish you with their actions.


## Ezekiel 23:25 (id: 926023025)

25For I will set my jealous anger on you, and they will deal with you in fury. They will cut off your noses and your ears, and your survivors will fall by the sword. They will take away your sons and your daughters, and your survivors will be devoured by fire.


## Ezekiel 23:26 (id: 926023026)

26They will strip you of your clothes and take away all of your jewelry.


## Ezekiel 23:27 (id: 926023027)

27So I will remove your shameful behavior from you and your acts of prostitution from the land of Egypt. You will not lift up your eyes toward them with longing, and you will think of Egypt no longer.’


## Ezekiel 23:28 (id: 926023028)

28For the Lord Yahweh says this, ‘Behold! I will give you into the hand of the ones you hate, back into the hand of the ones from whom you had turned away.


## Ezekiel 23:29 (id: 926023029)

29They will deal with you hatefully; they will take all your possessions and abandon you naked and bare, and your nakedness will be uncovered just as when you engaged in promiscuity and prostitutions.


## Ezekiel 23:30 (id: 926023030)

30These things will be done to you in your acting like a prostitute, lusting after nations by which you became unclean with their idols.


## Ezekiel 23:31 (id: 926023031)

31You have walked in the way of your sister, so I will put her cup of punishment into your hand.’


## Ezekiel 23:32 (id: 926023032)

32The Lord Yahweh says this, ‘You will drink your sister’s cup that is deep and large. You will become a laughingstock and a subject for derision—this cup contains a great amount.


## Ezekiel 23:33 (id: 926023033)

33You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, the cup of horror and devastation; the cup of your sister Samaria.


## Ezekiel 23:34 (id: 926023034)

34You will drink it and drain it empty; then you will shatter it and tear your breasts with the pieces. For I have declared it—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.’


## Ezekiel 23:35 (id: 926023035)

35Therefore, the Lord Yahweh says this, ‘Because you have forgotten me and thrown me away behind your back, so also you will bear the consequences of your shameful behavior and acts of sexual immorality.’”


## Ezekiel 23:36 (id: 926023036)

36Yahweh said to me, “Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? So present to them their disgusting actions,


## Ezekiel 23:37 (id: 926023037)

37since they have committed adultery, and since there is blood on their hands. They have committed adultery with their idols, and they have even caused their sons to pass through the fire, as food for their idols.


## Ezekiel 23:38 (id: 926023038)

38Then they continue to do this to me: They make my sanctuary unclean, and on the same day they defile my Sabbaths.


## Ezekiel 23:39 (id: 926023039)

39For when they had slaughtered their children for their idols, then they came to my sanctuary on the same day to defile it! So behold! This is what they have done in the middle of my house.


## Ezekiel 23:40 (id: 926023040)

40You sent out for men who came from far away, to whom messengers had been sent—now behold. They indeed came, those for whom you bathed, painted your eyes, and adorned yourself with jewelry.


## Ezekiel 23:41 (id: 926023041)

41There you sat on a beautiful bed and at a table arranged before it where you placed my incense and my oil.


## Ezekiel 23:42 (id: 926023042)

42So the sound of a noisy crowd was around her; including all kinds of men, even Sabeans were brought in from the wilderness, and they put bracelets on their hands and beautiful crowns on their heads.


## Ezekiel 23:43 (id: 926023043)

43Then I said of her who was worn out by adultery, ‘Now they will be sexually immoral with her, and she with them.’


## Ezekiel 23:44 (id: 926023044)

44They went in to her, as men go in to a prostitute. In this way they went in to Oholah and Oholibah, immoral women.


## Ezekiel 23:45 (id: 926023045)

45But righteous men will pass judgment and punish them as adulteresses, and they will punish them with the sentence for those who shed blood, because they are adulteresses and blood is on their hands.


## Ezekiel 23:46 (id: 926023046)

46So the Lord Yahweh says this: I will raise up a company against them and give them up to be terrorized and plundered.


## Ezekiel 23:47 (id: 926023047)

47Then that company will stone them with stones and cut them down with their swords. They will kill their sons and daughters and burn down their houses.


## Ezekiel 23:48 (id: 926023048)

48For I will remove shameful behavior from the land and discipline all the women so they will no longer act like prostitutes.


## Ezekiel 23:49 (id: 926023049)

49So they will set your shameful behavior against you. You will bear the guilt of your sins with your idols, and in this way you will know that I am the Lord Yahweh.”


## Ezekiel 24:1 (id: 926024001)

1The word of Yahweh came to me in the ninth year, in the tenth month, and on the tenth day of the month, saying,


## Ezekiel 24:2 (id: 926024002)

2“Son of man, write for yourself the name of this day, this exact day, for this exact day the king of Babylon has besieged Jerusalem.


## Ezekiel 24:3 (id: 926024003)

3So speak a proverb against this rebellious house, a parable. Say to them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Place the cooking pot. Place it and pour water into it.


## Ezekiel 24:4 (id: 926024004)

4Gather pieces of food within it, every good piece—the thigh and shoulder— and fill it with the best bones.


## Ezekiel 24:5 (id: 926024005)

5Take the best of the flock and pile up the bones under it. Bring it to a boil and cook the bones in it.


## Ezekiel 24:6 (id: 926024006)

6Therefore the Lord Yahweh says this: Woe to the city of blood, a cooking pot that has rust in it and that rust will not come out of it. Take piece after piece from it, but do not cast lots for it.


## Ezekiel 24:7 (id: 926024007)

7For her blood is in the midst of her. She has set it on the smooth rock; she has not poured it out on the ground to cover it with dust,


## Ezekiel 24:8 (id: 926024008)

8so it brings fury up to exact vengeance. I placed her blood on the smooth rock so it could not be covered.


## Ezekiel 24:9 (id: 926024009)

9Therefore, the Lord Yahweh says this: Woe to the city of blood. I will also enlarge the pile of wood.


## Ezekiel 24:10 (id: 926024010)

10Stack up the wood and kindle the fire. Cook the meat well and mix in the spices and let the bones be charred.


## Ezekiel 24:11 (id: 926024011)

11Then set the pot on its coals empty, in order to heat and scorch its bronze, so its uncleanness within it will be melted, its corrosion consumed.’


## Ezekiel 24:12 (id: 926024012)

12She has become weary because of toil, but her corrosion has not gone out of her by the fire.


## Ezekiel 24:13 (id: 926024013)

13Your shameful behavior is in your uncleanness. Because I tried to cleanse you but still you would not be cleansed from your uncleanness, you will not be cleansed anymore until I have satisfied my fury upon you.


## Ezekiel 24:14 (id: 926024014)

14I, Yahweh, have declared it, and I will do it. I will not relent nor will I rest from it. As your ways were, and as your activities, they will judge you!—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.”


## Ezekiel 24:15 (id: 926024015)

15Then the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 24:16 (id: 926024016)

16“Son of man! Behold, I am taking the desire of your eyes from you with a plague, but you must not mourn nor weep, and your tears must not flow.


## Ezekiel 24:17 (id: 926024017)

17You must groan silently. Do not conduct a funeral for the dead. Tie your turban on you and place your sandals on your feet, but do not veil your facial hair or eat the bread of men who mourn for having lost their wives.”


## Ezekiel 24:18 (id: 926024018)

18So I spoke to the people in the morning, and my wife died in the evening. In the morning I did what I had been commanded to do.


## Ezekiel 24:19 (id: 926024019)

19The people asked me, “Will you not tell us what these things mean, the things that you are doing?”


## Ezekiel 24:20 (id: 926024020)

20So I said to them, “The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 24:21 (id: 926024021)

21‘Say to the house of Israel, the Lord Yahweh says this: Behold! I will desecrate my sanctuary—the pride of your power, the delight of your eyes, and the yearning of your soul, and your sons and your daughters whom you left behind will fall by the sword.


## Ezekiel 24:22 (id: 926024022)

22Then you will do exactly as I have done: you will not veil your facial hair, nor eat the bread of mourning men!


## Ezekiel 24:23 (id: 926024023)

23Instead, your turbans will be on your heads, and your sandals on your feet; you will not mourn nor weep, for you will melt away in your iniquities, and each man will groan for his brother.


## Ezekiel 24:24 (id: 926024024)

24So Ezekiel will be a sign for you, as everything that he has done you will do when this comes. Then you will know that I am the Lord Yahweh!’”


## Ezekiel 24:25 (id: 926024025)

25“But you, son of man, on the day that I capture their temple, which is their joy, their pride, and what they see and desire—and when I take away their sons and daughters—


## Ezekiel 24:26 (id: 926024026)

26on that day, a refugee will come to you to give you the news!


## Ezekiel 24:27 (id: 926024027)

27On that day your mouth will be opened up to that refugee and you will speak—you will no longer be silent. You will be a sign for them so that they will know that I am Yahweh.”


## Ezekiel 25:1 (id: 926025001)

1Then the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 25:2 (id: 926025002)

2“Son of man, set your face against the people of Ammon and prophesy against them.


## Ezekiel 25:3 (id: 926025003)

3Say to the people of Ammon, ‘Hear the word of the Lord Yahweh. This is what the Lord Yahweh says: Because you said, “Aha!” over my sanctuary when it was profaned, and against the land of Israel when it was desolate, and against the house of Judah when they went into exile,


## Ezekiel 25:4 (id: 926025004)

4therefore, behold, I am giving you to a people in the east as their possession. They will set up camp against you and set up their tents among you. They will eat your fruit and they will drink your milk.


## Ezekiel 25:5 (id: 926025005)

5I will make Rabbah a pasture for camels and the people of Ammon a field for flocks. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.


## Ezekiel 25:6 (id: 926025006)

6For the Lord Yahweh says this: You have clapped your hands and stamped your feet, and rejoiced with all the contempt within you against the land of Israel.


## Ezekiel 25:7 (id: 926025007)

7Therefore, behold! I will strike you with my hand and give you as plunder to the nations. I will cut you off from the peoples and make you perish from among the countries! I will destroy you, and you will know that I am Yahweh.’


## Ezekiel 25:8 (id: 926025008)

8The Lord Yahweh says this, ‘Because Moab and Seir say, “Behold! The house of Judah is like every other nation.”


## Ezekiel 25:9 (id: 926025009)

9Therefore, behold! I will open the slopes of Moab, starting at his cities on the border—the splendor of Beth Jeshimoth, Baal Meon, and Kiriathaim—


## Ezekiel 25:10 (id: 926025010)

10to the people of the east who have been against the people of Ammon. I will give them up as a possession so that the people of Ammon will not be remembered among the nations.


## Ezekiel 25:11 (id: 926025011)

11So I will perform judgments against Moab, and they will know that I am Yahweh.’


## Ezekiel 25:12 (id: 926025012)

12The Lord Yahweh says this, ‘Edom has taken vengeance against the house of Judah and has committed wrong in doing so.


## Ezekiel 25:13 (id: 926025013)

13Therefore, the Lord Yahweh says this: I will strike Edom with my hand and destroy every person and animal there. I will make them a ruined, abandoned place, from Teman to Dedan. They will fall by the sword.


## Ezekiel 25:14 (id: 926025014)

14I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel, and they will do to Edom according to my anger and my fury, and they will know my vengeance—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.’


## Ezekiel 25:15 (id: 926025015)

15The Lord Yahweh says this, ‘The Philistines have taken vengeance with malice and from within themselves they tried to destroy Judah again and again.


## Ezekiel 25:16 (id: 926025016)

16So this is what the Lord Yahweh says: Behold! I will reach out with my hand against the Philistines, and I will cut off the Kerethites and destroy the remnant who are along the seacoast.


## Ezekiel 25:17 (id: 926025017)

17For I will take great vengeance against them with furious acts of punishment, so they will know that I am Yahweh, when I take my vengeance on them.’”


## Ezekiel 26:1 (id: 926026001)

1So it was in the eleventh year, on the first day of the month, that the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 26:2 (id: 926026002)

2“Son of man, because Tyre has said against Jerusalem, ‘Aha! The gates of the people are broken! She has turned to me; I will be filled up because she is ruined.’


## Ezekiel 26:3 (id: 926026003)

3Therefore the Lord Yahweh says this, ‘Behold! I am against you, Tyre, and I will raise up many nations against you like the sea raises its waves.


## Ezekiel 26:4 (id: 926026004)

4They will destroy the walls of Tyre and tear down her towers. I will sweep her dust away and make her like a bare rock.


## Ezekiel 26:5 (id: 926026005)

5She will become a place for nets to dry out in the midst of the sea, since I have declared it—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration—and she will become plunder for the nations.


## Ezekiel 26:6 (id: 926026006)

6Her daughters who are in the fields will be slaughtered by the swords, and they will know that I am Yahweh.’


## Ezekiel 26:7 (id: 926026007)

7For this is what Yahweh says: Behold, from the north I am bringing Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, king of kings, against Tyre, with horses and chariots, and with horsemen and a great many people.

36The merchants of the people hiss at you; you have become a horror, and you will be no more forever.”


## Ezekiel 28:1 (id: 926028001)

1Then the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 28:2 (id: 926028002)

2“Son of man, say to the ruler of Tyre, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Your heart is arrogant! You have said, “I am a god! I will sit in the seat of the gods in the heart of the seas!” Even though you are a man and not a god, you make your heart like the heart of a god;


## Ezekiel 28:3 (id: 926028003)

3you think that you are wiser than Daniel, and that no secret amazes you!


## Ezekiel 28:4 (id: 926028004)

4You have made yourself wealthy with wisdom and skill, and obtained gold and silver in your treasuries!


## Ezekiel 28:5 (id: 926028005)

5By great wisdom and by your trading, you have multiplied your wealth, so your heart is arrogant because of your wealth.


## Ezekiel 28:6 (id: 926028006)

6Therefore, the Lord Yahweh says this: Because you have made your heart like the heart of a god,


## Ezekiel 28:7 (id: 926028007)

7I will therefore bring foreigners against you, terrifying men from other nations. They will bring their swords against the beauty of your wisdom, and they will profane your splendor.


## Ezekiel 28:8 (id: 926028008)

8They will send you down to the pit, and you will die the death of those who die in the heart of the seas.


## Ezekiel 28:9 (id: 926028009)

9Will you truly say, “I am a god” to the face of one who kills you? You are a man and not God, and you will be in the hand of the one who pierces you.


## Ezekiel 28:10 (id: 926028010)

10You will die the death of the uncircumcised by the hand of foreigners, for I have declared it—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.’”


## Ezekiel 28:11 (id: 926028011)

11The word of Yahweh came again to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 28:12 (id: 926028012)

12“Son of man, lift up a lament for the king of Tyre and say to him, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: You were the model of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty.


## Ezekiel 28:13 (id: 926028013)

13You were in Eden, the garden of God. Every precious stone covered you: ruby, topaz, emerald, chrysolite, onyx, jasper, sapphire, turquoise, and beryl. Your settings and mountings were made from gold. It was on the day you were created that they were prepared.


## Ezekiel 28:14 (id: 926028014)

14I placed you on the holy mountain of God as the cherub I anointed to guard mankind. You were in the midst of the fiery stones where you walked about.


## Ezekiel 28:15 (id: 926028015)

15You had integrity in your ways from the day you were created until injustice was found within you.


## Ezekiel 28:16 (id: 926028016)

16Through your great trade you were filled with violence, and so you sinned. So I threw you out of the mountain of God, as one who was defiled, and I destroyed you, guardian cherub, and drove you from among the fiery stones.


## Ezekiel 28:17 (id: 926028017)

17Your heart was arrogant with your beauty; you ruined your wisdom because of your splendor. I have sent you down to the earth. I have placed you before kings so they may see you.


## Ezekiel 28:18 (id: 926028018)

18Because of your many sins and your dishonest trade, you have defiled your holy places. So I have made fire come out from you; it will consume you. I will turn you into ashes on the earth in the sight of all who look at you.


## Ezekiel 28:19 (id: 926028019)

19All the ones who knew you among the peoples will shudder at you; they will be horrified, and you will be no more forever.’”


## Ezekiel 28:20 (id: 926028020)

20Then the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 28:21 (id: 926028021)

21“Son of man, set your face against Sidon and prophesy against her.


## Ezekiel 28:22 (id: 926028022)

22Say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Behold! I am against you, Sidon! For I will be glorified in your midst so your people will know that I am Yahweh when I execute justice within you. I will be shown to be holy in you.


## Ezekiel 28:23 (id: 926028023)

23I will send out a plague in you and blood in your streets, and the slain will fall in your midst. When the sword comes against you from all around, then you will know that I am Yahweh.


## Ezekiel 28:24 (id: 926028024)

24Then there will no longer be pricking briars and painful thorns for the house of Israel from all those around her who despise her people, so they will know that I am the Lord Yahweh!’


## Ezekiel 28:25 (id: 926028025)

25The Lord Yahweh says this, ‘When I gather the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they were scattered, and when I am set apart among them, so the nations may see, then they will make their homes in the land I will give to my servant Jacob.


## Ezekiel 28:26 (id: 926028026)

26Then they will live securely within her and build houses, plant vineyards, and live securely when I execute justice on all the ones who now despise them from all around; so they will know that I am Yahweh their God!’”


## Ezekiel 29:1 (id: 926029001)

1In the tenth year, in the tenth month on the twelfth day of the month, the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 29:2 (id: 926029002)

2“Son of man, set your face against Pharaoh, the king of Egypt; prophesy against him and against all of Egypt.


## Ezekiel 29:3 (id: 926029003)

3Declare and say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Behold! I am against you, Pharaoh, king of Egypt. You, the great sea monster that lurks in the midst of the river, that says, “My river is my own. I have made it for myself.”


## Ezekiel 29:4 (id: 926029004)

4For I will place hooks in your jaw, and the fish of your Nile will cling to your scales; I will lift you up from the middle of your river along with all the fish of the river that cling to your scales.


## Ezekiel 29:5 (id: 926029005)

5I will throw you down into the wilderness, you and all the fish from your river. You will fall on the open field; you will not be gathered nor lifted up. I will give you as food to the living things of the earth and to the birds of the heavens.


## Ezekiel 29:6 (id: 926029006)

6Then all the inhabitants of Egypt will know that I am Yahweh, because they have been a reed stalk to the house of Israel.


## Ezekiel 29:7 (id: 926029007)

7When they took hold of you in their hand, you broke and tore open their shoulder; and when they leaned on you, you were broken, and you caused their legs to be unsteady.


## Ezekiel 29:8 (id: 926029008)

8Therefore the Lord Yahweh says this: Behold! I will bring a sword against you. I will cut off both man and beast from you.


## Ezekiel 29:9 (id: 926029009)

9So the land of Egypt will become desolate and a ruin. Then they will know that I am Yahweh, because the sea monster had said, “The river is mine, for I have made it.”


## Ezekiel 29:10 (id: 926029010)

10Therefore, behold! I am against you and against your river, so I will give the land of Egypt over to desolation and waste, and you will become a wasteland from the Migdol to Syene and the borders of Cush.


## Ezekiel 29:11 (id: 926029011)

11No man’s foot will pass through it, and no wild animal’s foot will pass through it. It will not be inhabited for forty years.


## Ezekiel 29:12 (id: 926029012)

12For I will make the land of Egypt a desolation in the midst of uninhabited lands, and its cities in the midst of wasted cities will become a desolation for forty years; then I will scatter Egypt among the nations, and I will disperse them through the lands.


## Ezekiel 29:13 (id: 926029013)

13For the Lord Yahweh says this: At the end of forty years I will gather Egypt from the peoples among whom they were scattered.


## Ezekiel 29:14 (id: 926029014)

14I will restore the fortunes of Egypt and bring them back to the region of Pathros, to the land of their origin. Then they will be a lowly kingdom there.


## Ezekiel 29:15 (id: 926029015)

15It will be the lowliest of the kingdoms, and it will not be lifted up any more among the nations. I will diminish them so they will no longer rule over nations.


## Ezekiel 29:16 (id: 926029016)

16The Egyptians will no longer be a reason for confidence for the house of Israel. Instead, they will be a reminder of the iniquity that Israel committed when they turned to Egypt for help. Then they will know that I am the Lord Yahweh.’”


## Ezekiel 29:17 (id: 926029017)

17Then it came about in the twenty\-seventh year on the first day of the first month, that the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 29:18 (id: 926029018)

18“Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon stationed his army to do hard work against Tyre. Every head was rubbed until it was made bald, and every shoulder was made raw. Yet he and his army received no payment from Tyre for the hard work that he carried out against it.


## Ezekiel 29:19 (id: 926029019)

19Therefore the Lord Yahweh says this, ‘Behold! I am giving the land of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and he will take away its wealth, plunder its possessions, and carry off all he finds there; that will be his army’s wages.


## Ezekiel 29:20 (id: 926029020)

20I have given him the land of Egypt as the wages for the work they did for me—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.


## Ezekiel 29:21 (id: 926029021)

21On that day I will make a horn sprout up for the house of Israel, and I make you speak in their midst, so that they will know that I am Yahweh.’”


## Ezekiel 30:1 (id: 926030001)

1The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 30:2 (id: 926030002)

2“Son of man, prophesy and say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Wail, “Woe is the coming day.”


## Ezekiel 30:3 (id: 926030003)

3The day is near. The day is near for Yahweh. It will be a day of clouds, a time of doom for nations.


## Ezekiel 30:4 (id: 926030004)

4Then a sword will come against Egypt, and there will be anguish in Cush when the killed people fall in Egypt— when they take her wealth, and when her foundations are ruined.


## Ezekiel 30:5 (id: 926030005)

5Cush and Put, Lydia and all Arabia, and Libya, together with the people belonging to the covenant—they will all fall by the sword.


## Ezekiel 30:6 (id: 926030006)

6Yahweh says this: So the ones who support Egypt will fall, and the pride of her strength will go down. From Migdol to Syene their soldiers will fall by the sword—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.


## Ezekiel 30:7 (id: 926030007)

7They will be appalled in the midst of the abandoned lands, and their cities will be among all the ruined cities.


## Ezekiel 30:8 (id: 926030008)

8Then they will know that I am Yahweh, when I set fire in Egypt, and when all of her helpers are destroyed.


## Ezekiel 30:9 (id: 926030009)

9In that day messengers will go out from before me in ships to terrorize a secure Cush, and there will be anguish among them on the day of Egypt’s doom. For behold! It is coming.


## Ezekiel 30:10 (id: 926030010)

10The Lord Yahweh says this: I will make an end of the multitudes of Egypt by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon.


## Ezekiel 30:11 (id: 926030011)

11He and his army with him, the terror of nations, will be brought to destroy the land; they will draw out their swords against Egypt and fill the land with those who have been killed.


## Ezekiel 30:12 (id: 926030012)

12I will make the rivers into dry ground, and I will sell the land into the hand of wicked men. I will make the land and its fullness desolate by the hand of strangers—I, Yahweh, have spoken.


## Ezekiel 30:13 (id: 926030013)

13The Lord Yahweh says this: I will destroy idols, and I will bring an end to the worthless idols of Memphis. There will no longer be a prince in the land of Egypt, and I will put terror on the land of Egypt.


## Ezekiel 30:14 (id: 926030014)

14Then I will make Pathros desolate and set fire in Zoan, and I will execute acts of judgment on Thebes.


## Ezekiel 30:15 (id: 926030015)

15For I will pour out my fury on Pelusium, the stronghold of Egypt, and cut off the multitude of Thebes.


## Ezekiel 30:16 (id: 926030016)

16Then I will set fire in Egypt; Pelusium will be in great agony, Thebes will be broken up, and Memphis will face enemies every day.


## Ezekiel 30:17 (id: 926030017)

17The young men in Heliopolis and Bubastis will fall by the sword, and their cities will go into captivity.


## Ezekiel 30:18 (id: 926030018)

18In Tahpanhes, the day will hold back its light when I break the yoke of Egypt there, and the pride of her strength will be finished. There will be a cloud covering her, and her daughters will walk into captivity.


## Ezekiel 30:19 (id: 926030019)

19I will execute acts of judgment in Egypt, so they will know that I am Yahweh.’”


## Ezekiel 30:20 (id: 926030020)

20Then it came about in the eleventh year, in the first month, in the seventh day of the month, that the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 30:21 (id: 926030021)

21“Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. Behold! It has not been bound up, or set to heal with a bandage, so that it will become strong enough to grasp a sword.


## Ezekiel 30:22 (id: 926030022)

22Therefore the Lord Yahweh says this, ‘Behold, I am against Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. For I will break his arm, both the strong one and the broken one, and I will make the sword fall from his hand.


## Ezekiel 30:23 (id: 926030023)

23Then I will scatter Egypt among the nations and disperse them among the lands.


## Ezekiel 30:24 (id: 926030024)

24I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon and place my sword in his hand so that I might destroy Pharaoh’s arms. He will groan before the king of Babylon with the groans of a dying man.


## Ezekiel 30:25 (id: 926030025)

25For I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, while Pharaoh’s arms will fall. Then they will know that I am Yahweh, when I put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon; for he will attack the land of Egypt with it.


## Ezekiel 30:26 (id: 926030026)

26So I will scatter Egypt among the nations and disperse them through the lands. Then they will know that I am Yahweh.’”


## Ezekiel 31:1 (id: 926031001)

1Then it came about in the eleventh year, in the third month, on the first day of the month, that the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 31:2 (id: 926031002)

2“Son of man, say to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and to his multitudes around him, ‘In your greatness, who are you like?


## Ezekiel 31:3 (id: 926031003)

3Behold! Assyria was a cedar in Lebanon with beautiful branches, giving shade to the forest, and the tallest in height, and the branches formed its treetop.


## Ezekiel 31:4 (id: 926031004)

4Many waters made it tall; the deep waters made it huge. Rivers flowed all around its area, for their channels stretched out to all the trees in the field.


## Ezekiel 31:5 (id: 926031005)

5Its great height was more than any of the other trees in the field, and its branches became very many; its branches grew long because of many waters as they grew.


## Ezekiel 31:6 (id: 926031006)

6Every bird of the heavens nested in its branches, while every living thing of the field gave birth to its young under its foliage. All of the many nations lived under its shade.


## Ezekiel 31:7 (id: 926031007)

7For it was beautiful in its greatness and the length of its branches, for its roots were in many waters.


## Ezekiel 31:8 (id: 926031008)

8Cedars in the garden of God could not equal it. None among the cypress trees matched its branches, and the plane tree could not equal its boughs. There was no other tree in the garden of God that was like it in its beauty.


## Ezekiel 31:9 (id: 926031009)

9I made it beautiful with its many branches and all the trees of Eden that were in the garden of God envied it.


## Ezekiel 31:10 (id: 926031010)

10Therefore the Lord Yahweh says this: Because it was tall in height, and it set its treetop between its branches, it lifted up its heart because of its height.


## Ezekiel 31:11 (id: 926031011)

11I have given it into the hand of a mighty one of the nations, to deal with it according to what its wickedness deserves. I have thrown it out.


## Ezekiel 31:12 (id: 926031012)

12Foreigners who were the terror of all the nations cut it off and left it to die. Its branches fell on the mountains and all the valleys, and its boughs lay broken in all the ravines of the land. Then all the nations on earth came out from under its shade and they went away from it.


## Ezekiel 31:13 (id: 926031013)

13All the birds of the sky rested on the trunk of the fallen tree, and every animal of the field came to its branches.


## Ezekiel 31:14 (id: 926031014)

14This happened so that no other trees that grow by the waters will lift up their foliage to the height of the tallest trees, and that no other trees that grow beside the waters will reach up to that height. All of them have been assigned to death, to the earth below, among the children of humanity, with those that go down to the pit.


## Ezekiel 31:15 (id: 926031015)

15The Lord Yahweh says this: On the day when the cedar went down to Sheol I brought mourning to the earth. I covered the deep waters over it, and I held back the ocean waters. I kept back the great waters, and I brought mourning to Lebanon for him. So all the trees of the field mourned because of it.


## Ezekiel 31:16 (id: 926031016)

16I brought shuddering to the nations at the sound of its downfall, when I threw it down to Sheol with those who went down into the pit. So I comforted all the trees of Eden in the lowest parts of the earth. These had been the choicest and best trees of Lebanon; the trees that drank the waters.


## Ezekiel 31:17 (id: 926031017)

17For they also went down with it to Sheol, to the ones who had been killed by the sword. These were its strong arm, those nations who had lived in its shade.


## Ezekiel 31:18 (id: 926031018)

18Which of the trees in Eden was your equal in glory and greatness? For you will be brought down with the trees of Eden to the lowest parts of the earth among the uncircumcised; you will live with those who were killed by the sword.’ This is Pharaoh and all of his multitudes—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.”


## Ezekiel 32:1 (id: 926032001)

1Then it happened in the twelfth month of the twelfth year, on the first of the month, that the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 32:2 (id: 926032002)

2“Son of man, lift up a lament concerning Pharaoh the king of Egypt; say to him, ‘You are like a young lion among the nations, but you are like a monster in the seas; you churn up the water, you stir up the waters with your feet and muddy their waters.


## Ezekiel 32:3 (id: 926032003)

3The Lord Yahweh says this: So I will spread my net over you in the assembly of many peoples, and they will lift you up in my net.


## Ezekiel 32:4 (id: 926032004)

4I will abandon you in the land. I will throw you into a field and cause all the birds of the heavens to settle on you; the hunger of all living animals on earth will be satisfied by you.


## Ezekiel 32:5 (id: 926032005)

5For I will put your flesh on the mountains, and I will fill the valleys with your worm\-filled corpse.


## Ezekiel 32:6 (id: 926032006)

6Then I will pour your blood over the mountains, and the stream beds will be filled with your blood.


## Ezekiel 32:7 (id: 926032007)

7Then when I extinguish you, I will cover the heavens and darken their stars; I will cover the sun with clouds, and the moon will not shine its light.


## Ezekiel 32:8 (id: 926032008)

8All the shining lights in the heavens I will darken over you, and I will put darkness over your land—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.


## Ezekiel 32:9 (id: 926032009)

9So I will terrify the heart of many peoples in lands that you do not know, when I bring about your collapse among the nations, among lands that you have not known.


## Ezekiel 32:10 (id: 926032010)

10I will shock many peoples concerning you; their kings will shudder in horror concerning you when I swing my sword before them. Every moment each one will tremble because of you, on the day of your downfall.


## Ezekiel 32:11 (id: 926032011)

11For the Lord Yahweh says this: The sword of the king of Babylon will come against you.


## Ezekiel 32:12 (id: 926032012)

12I will cause your multitudes to fall by warriors’ swords—each warrior a terror of nations. These warriors will devastate the pride of Egypt and destroy all of its multitudes.


## Ezekiel 32:13 (id: 926032013)

13For I will destroy all the livestock from beside the plentiful waters; the foot of man will no longer stir the waters up, neither will the hooves of cattle stir them.


## Ezekiel 32:14 (id: 926032014)

14Then I will calm their waters and make their rivers run like oil— this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.


## Ezekiel 32:15 (id: 926032015)

15When I make the land of Egypt an abandoned place, when the land is made bare of all its fullness, when I attack all the inhabitants in her, they will know that I am Yahweh.


## Ezekiel 32:16 (id: 926032016)

16There will be a lament; the daughters of the nations will lament over her; they will lament over Egypt, over all her multitudes they will lament—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.’”


## Ezekiel 32:17 (id: 926032017)

17Then it happened in the twelfth year, on the fifteenth day of the month, that the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 32:18 (id: 926032018)

18“Son of man, weep for the multitudes of Egypt and bring them down— her and the daughters of majestic nations—to the lowest earth with those who have gone down to the pit.


## Ezekiel 32:19 (id: 926032019)

19‘Are you really more beautiful than anyone else? Go down and lie down with the uncircumcised.’


## Ezekiel 32:20 (id: 926032020)

20They will fall among those who were killed by the sword. The sword has been drawn! She has been given to the sword; they will seize her and her multitudes.


## Ezekiel 32:21 (id: 926032021)

21The strongest of the warriors in Sheol will declare about Egypt and her allies, ‘They have come down here! They will lie with the uncircumcised, with those who were killed by the sword.’


## Ezekiel 32:22 (id: 926032022)

22Assyria is there with all her assembly. Her graves surround her; all of them were killed by the sword.


## Ezekiel 32:23 (id: 926032023)

23Those whose graves are set in the recesses of the pit are there, with all her assembly. Her graves surround all of those who were killed, who fell by the sword, those who brought terror on the land of the living.


## Ezekiel 32:24 (id: 926032024)

24Elam is there with all her multitudes. Her graves surround her; all of them were killed. Those who fell by the sword, who have gone down uncircumcised to the lowest parts of the earth, who brought their terrors on the land of the living and who carry their own shame, together with the ones going down to the pit.


## Ezekiel 32:25 (id: 926032025)

25They set a bedroll for Elam and all her multitudes in the midst of the slain; her graves surround her. All of them are uncircumcised, pierced by the sword, because they had brought their terrors on the land of the living. So they carry their own shame, together with the ones going down to the pit among all those who have been killed, those who are going down to the pit. Elam is among all those who were killed.


## Ezekiel 32:26 (id: 926032026)

26Meshech, Tubal, and all their multitudes are there! Their graves surround them. All of them are uncircumcised, killed by the sword, because they had brought their terrors on the land of the living.


## Ezekiel 32:27 (id: 926032027)

27They do not lie with the fallen warriors of the uncircumcised who have gone down to Sheol with all their weapons of war, and with their swords placed under their heads and their iniquities over their bones. For they were the terror of warriors in the land of the living.


## Ezekiel 32:28 (id: 926032028)

28So you, Egypt, will be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised! You will lie alongside those who were pierced by the sword.


## Ezekiel 32:29 (id: 926032029)

29Edom is there with her kings and all her leaders. They have been placed in their strength with those killed by the sword. With the uncircumcised they lie, with those who have gone down to the pit.


## Ezekiel 32:30 (id: 926032030)

30The princes of the north are there—all of them and all the Sidonians who went down with the ones who had been pierced. They were powerful and made others to be afraid, but now they are there in shame, uncircumcised with those who were pierced by the sword. They carry their own shame, together with the ones going down to the pit.


## Ezekiel 32:31 (id: 926032031)

31Pharaoh will look and be comforted about all his multitudes who were pierced by the sword—Pharaoh and all his army—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.


## Ezekiel 32:32 (id: 926032032)

32I put him as my terrifying one in the land of the living, but he will be laid down in the midst of the uncircumcised, among those pierced by the sword, Pharaoh and all his multitudes—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.”


## Ezekiel 33:1 (id: 926033001)

1Then the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 33:2 (id: 926033002)

2“Son of man, declare this to your people; say to them, ‘When I bring a sword against any land, then the people of that land take one man from among themselves and make him a watchman for them.


## Ezekiel 33:3 (id: 926033003)

3He looks for the sword as it comes on the land, and he blows his horn to warn the people!


## Ezekiel 33:4 (id: 926033004)

4If the people hear the sound of the horn but do not pay attention, and if the sword comes and kills them, then each one’s blood is on his own head.


## Ezekiel 33:5 (id: 926033005)

5If someone hears the sound of the horn and pays no attention, his blood is on him; but if he pays attention, he will save his own life.


## Ezekiel 33:6 (id: 926033006)

6However, if the watchman sees the sword as it is coming, but if he does not blow the horn, with the result that the people are not warned, and if the sword comes and takes anyone’s life, then that person dies in his own sin, but I will require his blood from the watchman.’


## Ezekiel 33:7 (id: 926033007)

7Now you yourself, son of man! I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel; you will hear the words from my mouth and warn them on my behalf.


## Ezekiel 33:8 (id: 926033008)

8If I say to a wicked person, ‘Wicked one, you will surely die!’ but if you do not announce this so as to warn the wicked about his way, then he who is wicked will die in his sin, but I will require his blood from your hand!


## Ezekiel 33:9 (id: 926033009)

9But you, if you warn the wicked about his way, so that he might turn back from it, and if he does not turn back from his way, then he will die in his sin, but you yourself will have saved your own life.


## Ezekiel 33:10 (id: 926033010)

10So you, son of man, say to the house of Israel, ‘You are saying this, “Our transgressions and our sins are on us, and we are decaying in them! How can we live?”’


## Ezekiel 33:11 (id: 926033011)

11Say to them, ‘As I live—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration—I do not delight in the death of the wicked, for if the wicked repents from his way, then he will live! Repent! Repent from your wicked ways! For why should you die, house of Israel?’


## Ezekiel 33:12 (id: 926033012)

12So now you, son of man, say to your people, ‘The righteousness of a righteous person will not save him if he sins! The wickedness of a wicked person will not cause him to perish if he repents from his sin! For the righteous person will not be able to live because of his righteousness if he sins.


## Ezekiel 33:13 (id: 926033013)

13If I say to the righteous, “He will surely live!” and if he trusts in his righteousness and then commits injustice, I will not call to mind any of his righteousness. He will die for the wickedness he committed.


## Ezekiel 33:14 (id: 926033014)

14So if I say to the wicked, “You will surely die,” but if he then repents from his sins and does what is just and right—


## Ezekiel 33:15 (id: 926033015)

15if he restores the loan guarantee that he wickedly demanded, or if he makes restitution for what he has stolen, and if he walks in the statutes that give life and no longer commits sin—then he will surely live. He will not die.


## Ezekiel 33:16 (id: 926033016)

16None of the sins that he has committed will be called to mind for him. He has acted justly and rightly, and so, he will surely live!


## Ezekiel 33:17 (id: 926033017)

17But your people say, “The way of the Lord is not fair!” but it is your ways that are not fair!


## Ezekiel 33:18 (id: 926033018)

18When the righteous person turns away from his righteousness and commits sin, then he will die in it!


## Ezekiel 33:19 (id: 926033019)

19When the wicked turns away from his wickedness and does what is just and righteous, he will live because of those things!


## Ezekiel 33:20 (id: 926033020)

20But you people say, “The way of the Lord is not fair!” I will judge each of you according to his way, house of Israel!’”


## Ezekiel 33:21 (id: 926033021)

21It happened in the twelfth year, on the fifth day of the tenth month of our captivity, that a fugitive came to me from Jerusalem and said, “The city has been captured!”


## Ezekiel 33:22 (id: 926033022)

22The hand of Yahweh had been on me in the evening before the fugitive came, and my mouth was opened by the time that he came to me in the dawn. So my mouth was open; I was no longer mute!


## Ezekiel 33:23 (id: 926033023)

23Then the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 33:24 (id: 926033024)

24“Son of man, the ones inhabiting those ruins in the land of Israel are talking and say, ‘Abraham was only one person, and he inherited the land, but we are many! The land has been given to us as a possession.’


## Ezekiel 33:25 (id: 926033025)

25Therefore say to them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: You eat blood, and you lift up your eyes towards your idols, then you pour out people’s blood. Should you really possess the land?


## Ezekiel 33:26 (id: 926033026)

26You have depended on your swords and have done disgusting things; each man defiles his neighbor’s wife. Should you really possess the land?’


## Ezekiel 33:27 (id: 926033027)

27You will say this to them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: As I live, surely the ones in the ruins will fall by the sword, and I will give those in the fields to the living creatures as food, and those in fortresses and in caves will die of plagues.


## Ezekiel 33:28 (id: 926033028)

28Then I will turn the land into a desolation and a horror, and the pride of its might will end, for the mountains of Israel will be deserted, and there will be no one to pass through them.’


## Ezekiel 33:29 (id: 926033029)

29So they will know that I am Yahweh, when I make the land a desolation and a waste because of all the abominations that they have done.


## Ezekiel 33:30 (id: 926033030)

30So now you, son of man—your people are saying things about you beside the walls and the gates of the houses, and each says to one another—each man to his brother, ‘Let us go and listen to the prophet’s word that comes out from Yahweh!’


## Ezekiel 33:31 (id: 926033031)

31So my people will come to you, as they often do, and will sit in front of you and listen to your words, but they will not obey them. Right words are in their mouths, but their hearts are going after unjust profit.


## Ezekiel 33:32 (id: 926033032)

32For you are like a lovely song to them, a beautiful sound that is well played on a stringed instrument, so they will listen to your words, but none of them will obey them.


## Ezekiel 33:33 (id: 926033033)

33So when all of this happens—behold! it will happen!—then they will know that a prophet has been among them.”


## Ezekiel 34:1 (id: 926034001)

1Then the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 34:2 (id: 926034002)

2“Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel. Prophesy and say to them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this to the shepherds: Woe to the shepherds of Israel who are shepherding themselves. Should not shepherds guard the flock?


## Ezekiel 34:3 (id: 926034003)

3You eat the fatty portions and you dress in wool. You slaughter the fatlings of the flock. You do not shepherd at all.


## Ezekiel 34:4 (id: 926034004)

4You have not strengthened those who have diseases, nor do you heal the ones who are ill. You do not bind up the ones who are broken, and you do not restore the outcasts or seek the lost. Instead, you rule over them through strength and violence.


## Ezekiel 34:5 (id: 926034005)

5Then they were scattered without a shepherd, and they became food for all the living beasts in the fields, after they were scattered.


## Ezekiel 34:6 (id: 926034006)

6My flock strays on all of the mountains and on every high hill, and it is dispersed over the entire surface of the earth. Yet no one is searching for them.


## Ezekiel 34:7 (id: 926034007)

7Therefore, shepherds, hear the word of Yahweh:


## Ezekiel 34:8 (id: 926034008)

8As I live—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration—because my flock has become plunder and food for all the beasts in the fields, because there was no shepherd and none of my shepherds sought my flock, but the shepherds guarded themselves and did not shepherd my flock.


## Ezekiel 34:9 (id: 926034009)

9Therefore, shepherds, hear the word of Yahweh:


## Ezekiel 34:10 (id: 926034010)

10The Lord Yahweh says this: Behold! I am against the shepherds, and I will require my flock from their hand. Then I will dismiss them from shepherding the flock; neither will the shepherds any longer shepherd themselves since I will take away my flock from their mouths, so that my flock will no longer be food for them.


## Ezekiel 34:11 (id: 926034011)

11For the Lord Yahweh says this: Behold! I myself will seek out my flock and I will look after them,


## Ezekiel 34:12 (id: 926034012)

12like a shepherd seeking his flock on the day he is within the midst of his scattered flock. Thus I will seek my flock, and I will rescue them from all the places where they were scattered on the day of clouds and darkness.


## Ezekiel 34:13 (id: 926034013)

13Then I will bring them out from among the peoples; I will gather them from the lands and bring them to their land. I will put them in pastures on the mountainsides of Israel, by the streams, and in every settlement in the land.


## Ezekiel 34:14 (id: 926034014)

14I will put them in good pastures; the high mountains of Israel will be their grazing places. They will lie down there in good places for grazing, in abundant pastures, and they will graze on the mountains of Israel.


## Ezekiel 34:15 (id: 926034015)

15I myself will shepherd my flock, and I myself will make them lie down—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration—


## Ezekiel 34:16 (id: 926034016)

16I will seek the lost and restore the outcast. I will bind up the broken sheep and heal the sick sheep but the fat and the strong I will destroy. I will shepherd with justice.


## Ezekiel 34:17 (id: 926034017)

17So now you, my flock—this is what the Lord Yahweh says—behold, I will be a judge between sheep and sheep and between rams and male goats.


## Ezekiel 34:18 (id: 926034018)

18Is it not enough to feed on the good pasture, that you must trample down with your feet what is left of the pasture; and to drink from clear waters, that you must muddy the rivers with your feet?


## Ezekiel 34:19 (id: 926034019)

19Must my sheep eat what you have trampled with your feet, and drink what you have muddied with your feet?


## Ezekiel 34:20 (id: 926034020)

20Therefore the Lord Yahweh says this to them: Behold! I myself will judge between the fat sheep and the thin ones,


## Ezekiel 34:21 (id: 926034021)

21for you have pushed them with your sides and shoulders, and you have gored all of the weak ones with your horns until you have scattered them away from the land.


## Ezekiel 34:22 (id: 926034022)

22I will save my flock and they will no longer be plunder, and I will judge between one sheep and another!


## Ezekiel 34:23 (id: 926034023)

23I will set over them one shepherd, my servant David. He will shepherd them, he will feed them, and he will be their shepherd.


## Ezekiel 34:24 (id: 926034024)

24For I, Yahweh, will be their God, and my servant David will be a prince among them—I, Yahweh, have declared this.


## Ezekiel 34:25 (id: 926034025)

25Then I will make a covenant of peace with them and remove the evil wild animals from the land, so that they will live securely in the wilderness and safely sleep in the forests.


## Ezekiel 34:26 (id: 926034026)

26I will also bring blessings on them and on the places around my hill, for I will send out showers in due season. These will be showers of blessing.


## Ezekiel 34:27 (id: 926034027)

27Then the trees of the field will produce their fruit, and the earth will yield its produce. My sheep will be secure in their land; then they will know that I am Yahweh, when I break the bars of their yoke, and when I rescue them from the hand of those who enslaved them.


## Ezekiel 34:28 (id: 926034028)

28They will no longer be plunder for the nations, and the wild animals on the earth will no longer devour them. For they will live securely, and no one will frighten them.


## Ezekiel 34:29 (id: 926034029)

29For I will provide them a land known for its crops; so they will not be victims of famine in the land, and they will not bear the scorn of the nations.


## Ezekiel 34:30 (id: 926034030)

30Then they will know that I, Yahweh their God, am with them. They are my people, the house of Israel—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.


## Ezekiel 34:31 (id: 926034031)

31For you are my sheep, the flock of my pasture, and my people, and I am your God—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.’”


## Ezekiel 35:1 (id: 926035001)

1Then the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 35:2 (id: 926035002)

2“Son of man, set your face against Mount Seir and prophesy against it.


## Ezekiel 35:3 (id: 926035003)

3Say to it, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Behold! I am against you, Mount Seir, and I will strike you with my hand and make you a desolation and a waste.


## Ezekiel 35:4 (id: 926035004)

4I will make your cities ruins, and you yourself will become desolate; then you will know that I am Yahweh.


## Ezekiel 35:5 (id: 926035005)

5Because you have always been hostile to the people of Israel, and because you poured them out into the hands of the sword at the time of their distress, at the time their punishment was at its greatest.


## Ezekiel 35:6 (id: 926035006)

6Therefore, as I live—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration—I will prepare you for bloodshed, and bloodshed will pursue you! Since you did not hate bloodshed, bloodshed will pursue you.


## Ezekiel 35:7 (id: 926035007)

7I will make Mount Seir a complete desolation when I cut off from it anyone who passes through and returns again.


## Ezekiel 35:8 (id: 926035008)

8I will fill its mountains with those who were killed; on your high hills and valleys and in all your streams those who were killed by the sword will fall.


## Ezekiel 35:9 (id: 926035009)

9I will make you a perpetual desolation. Your cities will not be inhabited, but you will know that I am Yahweh.


## Ezekiel 35:10 (id: 926035010)

10You have said, “These two nations and these two lands will become mine, and we will possess them,” even when Yahweh was present with them.


## Ezekiel 35:11 (id: 926035011)

11Therefore, as I live—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration—so I will do according to your anger and according to your jealousy that you had in your hatred of Israel, and I will show myself to them when I judge you.


## Ezekiel 35:12 (id: 926035012)

12So you will know that I am Yahweh. I have heard all the insults you spoke against the mountains of Israel, when you said, “They have been destroyed; they have been given over to us to devour.”


## Ezekiel 35:13 (id: 926035013)

13You exalted yourselves against me with what you said, and you multiplied the words you said against me; and I heard it all.


## Ezekiel 35:14 (id: 926035014)

14The Lord Yahweh says this: I will make you a desolation, while the entire earth rejoices.


## Ezekiel 35:15 (id: 926035015)

15As you rejoiced over the inheritance of the people of Israel because of its desolation, I will do the same to you. You will become a desolation, Mount Seir, and all of Edom—all of it! Then they will know that I am Yahweh.’”


## Ezekiel 36:1 (id: 926036001)

1“Now you, son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel and say, ‘Mountains of Israel, listen to the word of Yahweh.


## Ezekiel 36:2 (id: 926036002)

2The Lord Yahweh says this: The enemy has said about you, “Aha!” and “The ancient high places have become our possession.”’


## Ezekiel 36:3 (id: 926036003)

3Therefore prophesy and say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Because of your desolation and because of the attacks that came on you from all sides, you have become a possession of the other nations; you have been the subject of slanderous lips and tongues, and of people’s stories.


## Ezekiel 36:4 (id: 926036004)

4Therefore, mountains of Israel, listen to the word of the Lord Yahweh: The Lord Yahweh says this to the mountains and the high hills, to the streambeds and valleys, to the uninhabited desolations and the forsaken cities that have become plunder and a subject of mocking for the other nations that surround them—


## Ezekiel 36:5 (id: 926036005)

5therefore the Lord Yahweh says this: I have certainly spoken in the fire of my fury against the other nations, against Edom and all who took my land for themselves as a possession, against all those who had both joy in their heart and disdain in their spirit, as they seized my land that they might claim its pasturelands for themselves.’


## Ezekiel 36:6 (id: 926036006)

6Therefore, prophesy to the land of Israel and say to the mountains and to the high hills, to the streambeds and to the valleys, ‘the Lord Yahweh says this: Behold! In my fury and in my anger I am declaring this because you have borne the insults of nations.


## Ezekiel 36:7 (id: 926036007)

7Therefore, the Lord Yahweh says this: I myself will lift up my hand to swear that the nations that surround you will certainly carry their own shame.


## Ezekiel 36:8 (id: 926036008)

8But you, mountains of Israel, you will grow branches and bear fruit for my people Israel, since they will soon come back to you.


## Ezekiel 36:9 (id: 926036009)

9For behold, I am for you, and I treat you with favor; you will be plowed and sown with seed.


## Ezekiel 36:10 (id: 926036010)

10So I will multiply upon you the number of your people, even the whole house of Israel. The cities will be inhabited and the ruins rebuilt.


## Ezekiel 36:11 (id: 926036011)

11I will multiply man and beast on you mountains so that they will multiply and be fruitful. Then I will cause you to be inhabited as you previously were, and I will make you prosper more than you did in the past, for you will know that I am Yahweh.


## Ezekiel 36:12 (id: 926036012)

12I will bring men, my people Israel, to walk on you. They will possess you, and you will be their inheritance, and you will no longer cause their children to die.


## Ezekiel 36:13 (id: 926036013)

13The Lord Yahweh says this: Because they are saying to you, “You devour men, bereaving your nation of children,”


## Ezekiel 36:14 (id: 926036014)

14therefore you will not consume people any longer, and you will no longer make your nation mourn their deaths. This is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.


## Ezekiel 36:15 (id: 926036015)

15Nor will I allow you to hear the insults of the nations any longer; you will no longer have to bear the shame of the peoples or cause your nation to fall—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.’”


## Ezekiel 36:16 (id: 926036016)

16Then the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 36:17 (id: 926036017)

17“Son of man, when the house of Israel inhabited their land, they defiled it with their ways and their deeds. Their ways were like the unclean menstruation of a woman before me.


## Ezekiel 36:18 (id: 926036018)

18So I poured out my fury against them for the blood that they poured out on the land and for their pollution of it by their idols.


## Ezekiel 36:19 (id: 926036019)

19I scattered them among the nations; they were dispersed through the lands. I judged them according to their ways and their deeds.


## Ezekiel 36:20 (id: 926036020)

20Then they went to the nations, and wherever they went, they profaned my holy name when people said of them, ‘Are these really the people of Yahweh? For they have been thrown out of his land.’


## Ezekiel 36:21 (id: 926036021)

21But I had compassion for my holy name that the house of Israel had defiled among the nations, when they went there.


## Ezekiel 36:22 (id: 926036022)

22Therefore say to the house of Israel, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: I am not doing this for your sake, house of Israel, but for my holy name, which you have profaned among the nations everywhere you have gone.


## Ezekiel 36:23 (id: 926036023)

23For I will make my great name holy, which you have profaned among the nations—in the midst of the nations, you profaned it. Then the nations will know that I am Yahweh—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration—when you see that I am holy.


## Ezekiel 36:24 (id: 926036024)

24I will take you from the nations and gather you from every land, and I will bring you to your land.


## Ezekiel 36:25 (id: 926036025)

25Then I will sprinkle pure water on you so you will be purified from all of your impurities, and I will purify you from all of your idols.


## Ezekiel 36:26 (id: 926036026)

26I will give you a new heart and a new spirit in your innermost parts, and I will take away the heart of stone from your flesh. For I will give you a heart of flesh.


## Ezekiel 36:27 (id: 926036027)

27I will set my Spirit in you and enable you to walk in my statutes and keep my decrees, so you will do them.


## Ezekiel 36:28 (id: 926036028)

28Then you will inhabit the land that I gave to your ancestors; you will be my people, and I will be your God.


## Ezekiel 36:29 (id: 926036029)

29For I will save you from all of your uncleanness. I will summon the grain and multiply it. I will no longer put famine upon you.


## Ezekiel 36:30 (id: 926036030)

30I will multiply the fruit of the tree and the produce of the field so that you will no longer bear the shame of famine among the nations.


## Ezekiel 36:31 (id: 926036031)

31Then you will think of your wicked ways and your deeds that were not good, and you will show loathing on your faces because of your own sins and your disgusting deeds.


## Ezekiel 36:32 (id: 926036032)

32I am not doing this for your sake—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration—let this be known to you. So be ashamed and disgraced because of your ways, house of Israel.


## Ezekiel 36:33 (id: 926036033)

33The Lord Yahweh says this: On the day that I purify you from all your iniquity, I will cause you to inhabit the cities and to rebuild the ruined places.


## Ezekiel 36:34 (id: 926036034)

34For you will plow the ruined land until it is no longer a ruin before the eyes of all who pass by.


## Ezekiel 36:35 (id: 926036035)

35Then they will say, “This land was desolate, but it has become like the garden of Eden; the desolate cities and the uninhabited ruins that were torn down are now fortified and inhabited.”


## Ezekiel 36:36 (id: 926036036)

36Then the other nations around you will know that I am Yahweh, that I built up the ruins and replanted the abandoned places. I am Yahweh. I have declared it and I will do it.


## Ezekiel 36:37 (id: 926036037)

37The Lord Yahweh says this: Again I will be asked by the house of Israel to do this for them, to increase them like a flock of people.


## Ezekiel 36:38 (id: 926036038)

38Like the flock is set apart for sacrifices, like the flock in Jerusalem at her appointed feasts, so will the ruined cities be filled with flocks of people and they will know that I am Yahweh.’”


## Ezekiel 37:1 (id: 926037001)

1The hand of Yahweh was upon me, and he brought me out by the Spirit of Yahweh and set me down in the midst of a valley; it was full of bones.


## Ezekiel 37:2 (id: 926037002)

2Then he made me pass through them round and round. Behold! A great many of them were in the valley. Behold! They were very dry.


## Ezekiel 37:3 (id: 926037003)

3He said to me, “Son of man, can these bones live again?” So I said, “Lord Yahweh, you alone know.”


## Ezekiel 37:4 (id: 926037004)

4Then he said to me, “Prophesy over these bones and say to them, ‘Dry bones. Listen to the word of Yahweh.


## Ezekiel 37:5 (id: 926037005)

5The Lord Yahweh says this to these bones: Behold! I am about to put breath into you, and you will live.


## Ezekiel 37:6 (id: 926037006)

6I will place sinews over you and bring flesh onto you. I will cover you with skin and put breath within you so you will live. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.’”


## Ezekiel 37:7 (id: 926037007)

7So I prophesied as I was commanded; as I prophesied, behold, a sound came, that of shaking. Then the bones drew together—bone against bone.


## Ezekiel 37:8 (id: 926037008)

8I looked and, behold, sinews were now on them, and flesh grew up and skin covered them. But there was still no breath in them.


## Ezekiel 37:9 (id: 926037009)

9Then Yahweh said to me, “Prophesy to the breath, prophesy, son of man, and say to the breath, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Breath, come from the four winds, and breathe on these who have been killed, so they may live.’”


## Ezekiel 37:10 (id: 926037010)

10So I prophesied as I was commanded; the breath came into them and they lived. Then they stood on their feet, a very great army.


## Ezekiel 37:11 (id: 926037011)

11Then Yahweh said to me, “Son of man, these bones are the entire house of Israel. Behold! They are saying, ‘Our bones have dried up, and our hope is gone. We have been cut off.’


## Ezekiel 37:12 (id: 926037012)

12Therefore prophesy and say to them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Behold! I will open your graves and lift you out from them, my people. I will bring you back to the land of Israel.


## Ezekiel 37:13 (id: 926037013)

13Then you will know that I am Yahweh, when I open your graves and bring you out from them, my people.


## Ezekiel 37:14 (id: 926037014)

14I will place my Spirit within you so you will live, and I will cause you to rest in your land when you know that I am Yahweh. I declare and will do it—this is Yahweh’s declaration.’”


## Ezekiel 37:15 (id: 926037015)

15Then the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 37:16 (id: 926037016)

16“So now you, son of man, take one stick for yourself and write on it, ‘For Judah and for the people of Israel, his companions.’ Then take another stick and write on it, ‘For Joseph, the branch of Ephraim, and for all the people of Israel, their companions.’


## Ezekiel 37:17 (id: 926037017)

17Bring both of them together into one stick, so that they become one in your hand.


## Ezekiel 37:18 (id: 926037018)

18When your people speak to you and say, ‘Will you not tell us what these things of yours mean?’


## Ezekiel 37:19 (id: 926037019)

19then say to them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Behold! I am taking the branch of Joseph that is in the hand of Ephraim and the tribes of Israel his companions and joining it to the branch of Judah, so that they will make one branch, and they will become one in my hand.’


## Ezekiel 37:20 (id: 926037020)

20Hold in your hand the branches that you wrote on before their eyes.


## Ezekiel 37:21 (id: 926037021)

21Declare to them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Behold! I am about to take the people of Israel from among the nations where they went. I will gather them from the surrounding lands and I will bring them to their land.


## Ezekiel 37:22 (id: 926037022)

22I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel, and there will be one king as king over all of them, and they will no longer be two nations. They will no longer be divided into two kingdoms.


## Ezekiel 37:23 (id: 926037023)

23Then they will no longer defile themselves with their idols, their disgusting things, or any of their other sins. For I will save them from all of their faithless actions with which they have sinned, and I will purify them, so they will be my people and I will be their God.


## Ezekiel 37:24 (id: 926037024)

24David my servant will be king over them. So there will be one shepherd over them all, and they will walk according to my decrees and they will keep my statutes and obey them.


## Ezekiel 37:25 (id: 926037025)

25They will live in the land that I have given to my servant Jacob, where your fathers had stayed. They will live in it forever—they, their children, and their grandchildren, for David my servant will be their chief forever.


## Ezekiel 37:26 (id: 926037026)

26I will establish a covenant of peace with them. It will be an everlasting covenant with them. I will establish them and multiply them and set my holy place in their midst forever.


## Ezekiel 37:27 (id: 926037027)

27My dwelling place will be with them; I will be their God, and they will be my people.


## Ezekiel 37:28 (id: 926037028)

28Then the nations will know that I am Yahweh who sets Israel apart, when my holy place is among them forever.’”


## Ezekiel 38:1 (id: 926038001)

1The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,


## Ezekiel 38:2 (id: 926038002)

2“Son of man, set your face toward Gog, the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal; and prophesy against him.


## Ezekiel 38:3 (id: 926038003)

3Say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Behold! I am against you, Gog, chief prince of Meshech and Tubal.


## Ezekiel 38:4 (id: 926038004)

4So I will turn you around and set hooks in your jaw; I will send you out with all your army, horses, and horsemen, all of them dressed in full armor, a great company with large shields and small shields, all of them holding swords!


## Ezekiel 38:5 (id: 926038005)

5Persia, Cush, and Libya are with them, all of them with shields and helmets!


## Ezekiel 38:6 (id: 926038006)

6Gomer and all her troops, and Beth Togarmah, from the far parts of the north, and all its troops! Many peoples are with you!


## Ezekiel 38:7 (id: 926038007)

7Get ready! Yes, prepare yourself and your troops assembled with you, and be their commander.


## Ezekiel 38:8 (id: 926038008)

8You will be called after many days, and after some years you will go to a land that has recovered from the sword and that has been gathered from many peoples, gathered back to the mountains of Israel that had been a continuous ruin. But the land’s people will be brought out of the peoples, and they will live in safety, all of them!


## Ezekiel 38:9 (id: 926038009)

9So you will go up as a storm goes; you will be like a cloud covering the land, you and all your troops, all the many soldiers with you.


## Ezekiel 38:10 (id: 926038010)

10The Lord Yahweh says this: It will happen on that day that plans will form in your heart, and you will devise wicked schemes.’


## Ezekiel 38:11 (id: 926038011)

11Then you will say, ‘I will go up to the open land; I will go to the quiet people living in safety, all of them living where there are no walls or bars, and where there are no city gates.


## Ezekiel 38:12 (id: 926038012)

12I will capture booty and steal plunder, in order to bring my hand against the ruins that are newly inhabited, and against the people gathered from the nations, people who are gaining livestock and property, and who are living at the center of the earth.’


## Ezekiel 38:13 (id: 926038013)

13Sheba and Dedan, and the traders of Tarshish along with all its young warriors will say to you, ‘Have you come to plunder? Have you assembled your armies to take away spoil, to carry off silver and gold, to take their livestock and property and to haul away much plunder?’


## Ezekiel 38:14 (id: 926038014)

14Therefore prophesy, son of man, and say to Gog, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: On that day, when my people Israel are living securely, will you not learn about them?


## Ezekiel 38:15 (id: 926038015)

15You will come from your place far away in the north with a great army, all of them riding on horses, a great company, a large army.


## Ezekiel 38:16 (id: 926038016)

16You will attack my people Israel like a cloud that covers the land. In the latter days I will bring you against my land, so the nations might know me when I show myself through you, Gog, to be holy before their eyes.


## Ezekiel 38:17 (id: 926038017)

17The Lord Yahweh says this: Are you not the one of whom I spoke in former days by the hand of my servants, the prophets of Israel, who prophesied in their own time for years that I would bring you against them?


## Ezekiel 38:18 (id: 926038018)

18So it will come to be in that day when Gog attacks the land of Israel—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration—my wrath will mount up in my anger.


## Ezekiel 38:19 (id: 926038019)

19In my zeal and in the fire of my anger, I declare that on that day there will be a great earthquake in the land of Israel.


## Ezekiel 38:20 (id: 926038020)

20They will shake before me—the fish of the sea and the birds of the skies, the beasts of the fields, and all the creatures that crawl on the earth, and every person who is on the surface of the land. The mountains will be thrown down and the cliffs will fall, until every wall falls to the earth.


## Ezekiel 38:21 (id: 926038021)

21I will summon a sword against him on all my mountains—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration—each man’s sword will be against his brother.


## Ezekiel 38:22 (id: 926038022)

22Then I will judge him by plague and blood; and overflowing rain and hailstones and burning sulfur I will rain down upon him and his troops and the many nations that are with him.


## Ezekiel 38:23 (id: 926038023)

23For I will show my greatness and my holiness and I will make myself known in the eyes of the many nations, and they will know that I am Yahweh.’”


## Ezekiel 39:1 (id: 926039001)

1“Now you, son of man, prophesy against Gog and say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Behold! I am against you, Gog, chief of Meshech and Tubal.


## Ezekiel 39:2 (id: 926039002)

2I will turn you and lead you on; I will bring you up from the far north and bring you to the mountains of Israel.


## Ezekiel 39:3 (id: 926039003)

3Then I will knock your bow out of your left hand and make the arrows fall from your right hand.


## Ezekiel 39:4 (id: 926039004)

4You will fall on the mountains of Israel—you and all your troops and the soldiers who are with you. I will give you to the birds of prey and the wild beasts of the fields for food.


## Ezekiel 39:5 (id: 926039005)

5You will fall on the open field, for I myself declare it—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.


## Ezekiel 39:6 (id: 926039006)

6Then I will send out fire on Magog and on those living in safety on the coasts, and they will know that I am Yahweh.


## Ezekiel 39:7 (id: 926039007)

7For I will make my holy name known in the midst of my people Israel, and I will no longer allow my holy name to be profaned; the nations will know that I am Yahweh, the Holy One in Israel.


## Ezekiel 39:8 (id: 926039008)

8Behold! The day is coming, and it will take place—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.


## Ezekiel 39:9 (id: 926039009)

9The ones living in the cities of Israel will go out and they will use weapons to kindle and make fires and burn them—small shields, large shields, bows, arrows, the clubs and spears; they will make fires with them for seven years.


## Ezekiel 39:10 (id: 926039010)

10They will not gather wood from the fields or cut down trees from the forests, since they will burn the weapons; they will take from those who wanted to take from them; they will plunder those who wanted to plunder them—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.”


## Ezekiel 39:11 (id: 926039011)

11Then it will happen on that day that I will make a place there for Gog—a grave in Israel, a valley for those who journey to the east of the sea. It will block those who wish to cross over. There they will bury Gog with all his multitudes. They will call it the Valley of Hamon Gog.


## Ezekiel 39:12 (id: 926039012)

12For seven months the house of Israel will bury them in order to purify the land.


## Ezekiel 39:13 (id: 926039013)

13For all the people of the land will bury them; it will be a memorable day for them when I am glorified—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.


## Ezekiel 39:14 (id: 926039014)

14Then they will designate men to continually go through the land, to find those who were traveling through, but who died and their bodies remained on the surface of the land, so that they may bury them, in order to cleanse the land. At the end of the seventh month they will begin their search.


## Ezekiel 39:15 (id: 926039015)

15As these men pass through the land, when they see any human bone, they will put a marker by it, until gravediggers come and bury it in the Valley of Hamon Gog.


## Ezekiel 39:16 (id: 926039016)

16There will be a city there by the name of Hamonah. In this way they will purify the land.


## Ezekiel 39:17 (id: 926039017)

17Now to you, son of man, the Lord Yahweh says this: Say to all the winged birds and all the wild beasts in the fields, ‘Gather together and come. Gather from all around to the sacrifice that I myself am making for you, a large sacrifice on the mountains of Israel, so that you may consume flesh and drink blood.


## Ezekiel 39:18 (id: 926039018)

18You will consume the flesh of warriors and drink the blood of the princes of the earth; they will be rams, lambs, goats, and bulls, they were all fattened in Bashan.


## Ezekiel 39:19 (id: 926039019)

19Then you will eat fat to your satisfaction; you will drink blood until drunkenness; this will be the sacrifice that I will slaughter for you.


## Ezekiel 39:20 (id: 926039020)

20You will be satisfied at my table with horse, chariot, warrior, and every man of war—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.’


## Ezekiel 39:21 (id: 926039021)

21I will set my glory among the nations, and all the nations will see my judgment that I perform and my hand that I have set against them.


## Ezekiel 39:22 (id: 926039022)

22The house of Israel will know that I am Yahweh their God from that day onward.


## Ezekiel 39:23 (id: 926039023)

23The nations will know that the house of Israel went into captivity because of their iniquity by which they betrayed me, so I hid my face from them and gave them into the hand of their adversaries so that all of them fell by the sword.


## Ezekiel 39:24 (id: 926039024)

24I did to them according to their uncleanness and their sins, when I hid my face from them.


## Ezekiel 39:25 (id: 926039025)

25Therefore the Lord Yahweh says this: Now I will restore the fortunes of Jacob, and I will have compassion on all the house of Israel, when I act with zeal for my holy name.


## Ezekiel 39:26 (id: 926039026)

26Then they will bear their shame and all the treason in which they betrayed me. They will forget all this when they rest in their land in safety, with no one to terrify them.


## Ezekiel 39:27 (id: 926039027)

27When I restore them from the peoples and gather them from the lands of their enemies, I will show myself to be holy in the sight of many nations.


## Ezekiel 39:28 (id: 926039028)

28Then they will know that I am Yahweh their God, for I sent them into captivity among the nations, but then I will gather them back to their land. I will not leave any of them among the nations.


## Ezekiel 39:29 (id: 926039029)

29I will no longer hide my face from them when I pour out my Spirit on the house of Israel—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.”


## Ezekiel 40:1 (id: 926040001)

1In the twenty\-fifth year of our captivity at the beginning of the year on the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city was captured—on that same day, the hand of Yahweh was upon me and he took me there.


## Ezekiel 40:2 (id: 926040002)

2In visions from God he brought me to the land of Israel. He brought me to rest on a very high mountain; to the south were what appeared to be buildings of a city.


## Ezekiel 40:3 (id: 926040003)

3Then he brought me there. Behold, a man! His appearance was like the appearance of bronze. A linen cord and a measuring stick were in his hand, and he stood in the city gate.


## Ezekiel 40:4 (id: 926040004)

4The man said to me, “Son of man, look with your eyes and listen with your ears, and fix your mind on all that I am revealing to you, for you were brought here so I could reveal them to you. Report everything that you will see to the house of Israel.”


## Ezekiel 40:5 (id: 926040005)

5There was a wall surrounding the temple area. The length of the measuring stick in the man’s hand was six long cubits. Each long cubit was a cubit and a handbreadth in length. So he measured the wall, and it was one measuring stick thick and one rod high.


## Ezekiel 40:6 (id: 926040006)

6Then he went to the temple gate that faced east. He went up its steps and measured the threshold of the gate—one stick in depth.


## Ezekiel 40:7 (id: 926040007)

7The guard chambers were each one stick in length and one stick in width; there were five cubits between any two of the chambers, and the threshold of the temple gate by the temple portico was one stick deep.


## Ezekiel 40:8 (id: 926040008)

8He measured the portico of the gate; it was one stick in length.


## Ezekiel 40:9 (id: 926040009)

9He measured the portico of the gate. It was one stick deep. The doorposts were two cubits in width. This was the portico of the gate facing the temple.


## Ezekiel 40:10 (id: 926040010)

10There were three guard chambers on either side of the east gate, and each of them had the same measurement, and the walls that separated them had the same measurement.


## Ezekiel 40:11 (id: 926040011)

11Then the man measured the width of the gateway entrance—ten cubits; and he measured the length of the gateway entrance—thirteen cubits.


## Ezekiel 40:12 (id: 926040012)

12He measured the wall that was bordering the front of the chambers—one cubit high. The chambers measured six cubits on each side.


## Ezekiel 40:13 (id: 926040013)

13Then he measured the gateway from the roof of one chamber to that of the next chamber—twenty\-five cubits, from the entrance of the first chamber to that of the second.


## Ezekiel 40:14 (id: 926040014)

14Then he measured the wall that went between the guard chambers—sixty cubits in length; he measured as far as the gate’s portico.


## Ezekiel 40:15 (id: 926040015)

15The entrance from the front of the gate to the other end of the gate’s portico was fifty cubits.


## Ezekiel 40:16 (id: 926040016)

16There were closed windows toward the chambers and toward their pillars within the gates all around; and likewise for the porches. There were windows all around the inside, and each jamb was decorated with palm trees.


## Ezekiel 40:17 (id: 926040017)

17Then the man brought me to the outer courtyard of the temple. Behold, there were rooms, and there was pavement in the courtyard, with thirty rooms next to the pavement.


## Ezekiel 40:18 (id: 926040018)

18The pavement went up to the side of the gates, and its width was the same as the gates’ length. This was the lower pavement.


## Ezekiel 40:19 (id: 926040019)

19Then the man measured the distance from the front of the lower gate to the front of the inner gate; it was one hundred cubits on the east side, and the same on the north side.


## Ezekiel 40:20 (id: 926040020)

20Then he measured the length and width of the gate that was at the north of the outer court.


## Ezekiel 40:21 (id: 926040021)

21There were three chambers on either side of that gate, and the gate and its portico measured the same as the main gate—fifty cubits in total length and twenty\-five cubits in width.


## Ezekiel 40:22 (id: 926040022)

22Its windows, portico, chambers, and its palm trees corresponded to the gate that faced east. Seven steps went up to it and to its portico.


## Ezekiel 40:23 (id: 926040023)

23There was a gate to the inner courtyard in front of the gate facing north, just as also there was a gate to the east; the man measured from one gate to the other gate—one hundred cubits in distance.


## Ezekiel 40:24 (id: 926040024)

24Next the man brought me to the gate of the southern entrance, and its walls and portico measured the same as the other outer gates.


## Ezekiel 40:25 (id: 926040025)

25There were closed windows in the gateway and its portico just as at that gate. The south gate and its portico measured fifty cubits in length and twenty\-five cubits in width.


## Ezekiel 40:26 (id: 926040026)

26There were seven steps up to the gate and its portico, and there were carvings of palm trees on the walls on either side.


## Ezekiel 40:27 (id: 926040027)

27There was a gate to the inner courtyard on the southern side, and the man measured from that gate to the gate of the south entrance—one hundred cubits in distance.


## Ezekiel 40:28 (id: 926040028)

28Then the man brought me to the inner courtyard by way of its southern gate, which had the same measurements as the other gates.


## Ezekiel 40:29 (id: 926040029)

29Its chambers, walls, and porticos measured the same as the other gates; there were windows all around in the portico. The inner gate and its portico measured fifty cubits in length and twenty\-five cubits in width.


## Ezekiel 40:30 (id: 926040030)

30There were also porticos all around the inner wall; these were twenty\-five cubits in length and five cubits in width.


## Ezekiel 40:31 (id: 926040031)

31This portico faced the outer courtyard with carved palm trees on its walls and eight steps going up to it.


## Ezekiel 40:32 (id: 926040032)

32Then the man brought me to the inner courtyard by the eastern way and measured the gate, which had the same measurements as the other gates.


## Ezekiel 40:33 (id: 926040033)

33Its chambers, walls, and portico measured the same as the other gates, and there were windows all around. The inner gate and its portico measured fifty cubits in length and twenty\-five cubits in width.


## Ezekiel 40:34 (id: 926040034)

34Its portico faced the outer courtyard; it had palm trees on either side of it and eight steps going up it.


## Ezekiel 40:35 (id: 926040035)

35Next the man brought me to the northern gate and measured it; it measured the same as the other gates.


## Ezekiel 40:36 (id: 926040036)

36Its chambers, walls, and portico measured the same as the other gates, and there were windows all around. The gateway and its portico measured fifty cubits in length and twenty\-five cubits in width.


## Ezekiel 40:37 (id: 926040037)

37Its portico faced the outer courtyard; it had palm trees on either side of it and eight steps going up it.


## Ezekiel 40:38 (id: 926040038)

38There was a room with a door by each of the inner gateways. This was where they rinsed the burnt offerings.


## Ezekiel 40:39 (id: 926040039)

39There were two tables on each side of each portico, on which the burnt offering was slaughtered, and also the sin offering and the guilt offering.


## Ezekiel 40:40 (id: 926040040)

40By the wall of the courtyard, going up to the gate to the north, there were two tables. Also on the other side there were two tables at the gate’s portico.


## Ezekiel 40:41 (id: 926040041)

41There were four tables on either side by the gate; they slaughtered animals on the eight tables.


## Ezekiel 40:42 (id: 926040042)

42There were four tables of cut stone for the burnt offerings, one and a half cubits in length, one and a half cubits in width, and one cubit tall. On them they laid the tools with which they slaughtered the burnt offerings for the sacrifices.


## Ezekiel 40:43 (id: 926040043)

43Two\-pronged hooks a handbreadth in length were fastened in the portico all around, and the flesh of the offerings would be put on the tables.


## Ezekiel 40:44 (id: 926040044)

44On the outside of the inner gate, within the inner courtyard, were singers’ chambers, one on the north side facing south, and the other on the south side facing north.


## Ezekiel 40:45 (id: 926040045)

45Then the man said to me, “This room facing south is for the priests who are on duty in the temple.


## Ezekiel 40:46 (id: 926040046)

46The room facing north is for the priests on duty at the altar. These are the sons of Zadok who come near to Yahweh to serve him; they are among the sons of Levi.”


## Ezekiel 40:47 (id: 926040047)

47Next he measured the courtyard—one hundred cubits in length and one hundred cubits in width in a square, with the altar in front of the house.


## Ezekiel 40:48 (id: 926040048)

48Then the man brought me to the portico of the house and measured its doorposts—they were five cubits thick on either side. The entryway itself was fourteen cubits in width, and the walls on each side of it were three cubits in width.


## Ezekiel 40:49 (id: 926040049)

49The length of the portico was twenty cubits, and its depth was eleven cubits. There were steps that went up to it and columns that stood on either side of it.


## Ezekiel 41:1 (id: 926041001)

1Then the man brought me into the temple’s holy place and measured the doorposts—six cubits in width on either side.


## Ezekiel 41:2 (id: 926041002)

2The width of the doorway was ten cubits; the wall on each side was five cubits in length. Then the man measured the dimensions of the holy place—forty cubits in length and twenty cubits in width.


## Ezekiel 41:3 (id: 926041003)

3Then the man went into the very holy place and measured the posts of the doorway—two cubits, and the doorway was six cubits in width. The walls on either side were seven cubits in width.


## Ezekiel 41:4 (id: 926041004)

4Then he measured the room’s length—twenty cubits. Its width—twenty cubits to the front of the temple hall. Then he said to me, “This is the most holy place.”


## Ezekiel 41:5 (id: 926041005)

5Then the man measured the wall of the house—it was six cubits thick. The width of each side room around the house was four cubits in width.


## Ezekiel 41:6 (id: 926041006)

6There were side rooms on three levels, one room above another, thirty rooms on each level. There were ledges around the wall of the house, to support all of the side rooms, for there was no support put in the wall of the house.


## Ezekiel 41:7 (id: 926041007)

7So the side rooms widened and went around going up, for the house went around higher and higher all around; the rooms widened as the house went up, and a stairway went up to the highest level, through the middle level.


## Ezekiel 41:8 (id: 926041008)

8Then I saw a raised part all around the house, the foundation for the side chambers; it measured a full stick in height—six cubits.


## Ezekiel 41:9 (id: 926041009)

9The width of the wall of the side rooms on the outside was five cubits. There was an open space to the outside of these rooms in the sanctuary.


## Ezekiel 41:10 (id: 926041010)

10On the other side of this open space were the priests’ outer side rooms; this space was twenty cubits in width all around the sanctuary.


## Ezekiel 41:11 (id: 926041011)

11There were doors into the side rooms from another open space—one doorway was on the north side, and the other on the south side. The width of this open area was five cubits all around.


## Ezekiel 41:12 (id: 926041012)

12The building that faced the courtyard on the west side was seventy cubits in width. Its wall measured five cubits thick all around, and it was ninety cubits in length.


## Ezekiel 41:13 (id: 926041013)

13Then the man measured the sanctuary—one hundred cubits in length. The separated building, its wall, and the courtyard also measured one hundred cubits in length.


## Ezekiel 41:14 (id: 926041014)

14The width of the front of the courtyard in front of the sanctuary was also one hundred cubits.


## Ezekiel 41:15 (id: 926041015)

15Then the man measured the length of the building behind the sanctuary, to its west, and the galleries on either side—one hundred cubits. The holy place and the portico,


## Ezekiel 41:16 (id: 926041016)

16the inner walls and the windows, including the narrow windows, and the galleries all around on three levels, were all paneled in wood.


## Ezekiel 41:17 (id: 926041017)

17Above the entryway to the inner sanctuary and spaced along the walls there was a measured pattern.


## Ezekiel 41:18 (id: 926041018)

18It was decorated with cherubim and palm trees; with a palm tree between each cherub, and each cherub had two faces:


## Ezekiel 41:19 (id: 926041019)

19the face of a man looked toward a palm tree on one side, and the face of a young lion looked toward a palm tree on the other side. They were carved all around the entire house.


## Ezekiel 41:20 (id: 926041020)

20From the ground to above the doorway, cherubim and palm trees were carved on the outer wall of the house.


## Ezekiel 41:21 (id: 926041021)

21The gate posts of the holy place were square. Their appearance was like the appearance of


## Ezekiel 41:22 (id: 926041022)

22the wooden altar in front of the holy place, which was three cubits high and two cubits in length on each side. Its corner posts, base, and frame were made of wood. Then the man said to me, “This is the table that stands before Yahweh.”


## Ezekiel 41:23 (id: 926041023)

23There were double doors for the holy place and the most holy place.


## Ezekiel 41:24 (id: 926041024)

24These doors had two hinged door panels each, two panels for one door and two panels for the other.


## Ezekiel 41:25 (id: 926041025)

25Carved on them—on the doors of the holy place—were cherubim and palm trees just as the walls were decorated, and there was a wooden roof over the portico at the front.


## Ezekiel 41:26 (id: 926041026)

26There were narrow windows and palm trees on either side of the portico. These were the side rooms of the house, and they also had overhanging roofs.


## Ezekiel 42:1 (id: 926042001)

1Next the man sent me out to the outer courtyard on the north side, and he brought me to rooms in front of the outer courtyard and the northern outer wall.


## Ezekiel 42:2 (id: 926042002)

2Those rooms were one hundred cubits along their front and fifty cubits in width.


## Ezekiel 42:3 (id: 926042003)

3Some of those rooms faced the inner courtyard and were twenty cubits away from the sanctuary. There were three levels of rooms, and the ones above looked down on the ones below and were open to them, having a walkway. Some of the rooms looked out onto the outer courtyard.


## Ezekiel 42:4 (id: 926042004)

4A passage ten cubits in width and one hundred cubits in length ran in front of the rooms. The rooms’ doors were toward the north.


## Ezekiel 42:5 (id: 926042005)

5But the upper halls were smaller, for the walkways took away from them more space than they did in the lowest and middle levels of the building.


## Ezekiel 42:6 (id: 926042006)

6For the halls on the third story had no columns, unlike the courtyards, which did have columns. So the highest level’s rooms were smaller in size compared to the rooms in the lowest and middle levels.


## Ezekiel 42:7 (id: 926042007)

7The outside wall ran along the rooms toward the outer courtyard, the courtyard that was in front of the rooms. That wall was fifty cubits in length.


## Ezekiel 42:8 (id: 926042008)

8The length of the rooms of the outer courtyard was fifty cubits, and the rooms facing the sanctuary were one hundred cubits in length.


## Ezekiel 42:9 (id: 926042009)

9There was an entrance to the lowest rooms from the east side, coming from the outer courtyard.


## Ezekiel 42:10 (id: 926042010)

10Along the wall of the outer courtyard on the eastern side of the outer courtyard, in front of the sanctuary’s inner courtyard, there were also rooms


## Ezekiel 42:11 (id: 926042011)

11with a walkway in front of them. They were as the appearance of the rooms on the northern side. They had the same length and breadth and the same exits and arrangements and doors.


## Ezekiel 42:12 (id: 926042012)

12On the south side were doors into rooms that were just the same as on the north side. A passage on the inside had a door at its head, and the passage opened into the various rooms. On the east side there was a doorway into the passage at one end.


## Ezekiel 42:13 (id: 926042013)

13Then the man said to me, “The northern rooms and the southern rooms that are in front of the outer courtyard are holy rooms where the priests who work nearest to Yahweh may eat the most holy food. They will put the most holy things there—the food offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering—for this is a holy place.


## Ezekiel 42:14 (id: 926042014)

14When the priests enter there, they must not go out of the holy place to the outer court, without laying aside the clothes in which they served, since these are holy. So they must dress in other clothes before going near the people.”


## Ezekiel 42:15 (id: 926042015)

15The man completed measuring the inner house and then took me out to the gate that faced the east and measured all the surrounding area there.


## Ezekiel 42:16 (id: 926042016)

16He measured the east side with a measuring stick—five hundred cubits with the measuring stick.


## Ezekiel 42:17 (id: 926042017)

17He measured the north side—five hundred cubits with the measuring stick.


## Ezekiel 42:18 (id: 926042018)

18He also measured the south side—five hundred cubits with the measuring stick.


## Ezekiel 42:19 (id: 926042019)

19He also turned and measured the west side—five hundred cubits with the measuring stick.


## Ezekiel 42:20 (id: 926042020)

20He measured it on four sides. It had a wall around it that was five hundred cubits in length, and five hundred cubits in width, to separate the holy from that which is common.


## Ezekiel 43:1 (id: 926043001)

1The man then brought me to the gate that opened to the east.


## Ezekiel 43:2 (id: 926043002)

2Behold! The glory of the God of Israel came from the east; his voice was like the sound of many waters, and the earth shone with his glory.


## Ezekiel 43:3 (id: 926043003)

3It was according to the appearance of the vision that I saw, according to the vision that I saw when he had come to destroy the city, and the visions were like the vision that I saw at the Kebar Canal—and I fell to my face.


## Ezekiel 43:4 (id: 926043004)

4So the glory of Yahweh came to the house by way of the gate that opened to the east.


## Ezekiel 43:5 (id: 926043005)

5Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court. Behold! The glory of Yahweh was filling the house.


## Ezekiel 43:6 (id: 926043006)

6The man was standing beside me, and I heard someone else speaking to me from the house.


## Ezekiel 43:7 (id: 926043007)

7He said to me, “Son of man, this is the place of my throne and the place for the soles of my feet, where I will live in the midst of the people of Israel forever. The house of Israel will no longer profane my holy name—they or their kings—with their faithlessness or with the corpses of their kings at their high places.


## Ezekiel 43:8 (id: 926043008)

8They will no longer profane my holy name by putting their threshold next to my threshold, and their gateposts next to my gateposts, with nothing but a wall between me and them. They profaned my holy name with their disgusting actions, so I consumed them with my anger.


## Ezekiel 43:9 (id: 926043009)

9Now let them remove their faithlessness and the corpses of their kings from before me, and I will live in their midst forever.


## Ezekiel 43:10 (id: 926043010)

10Son of man, you yourself must tell the house of Israel about this house so they will be ashamed of their iniquities. They should think about this description.


## Ezekiel 43:11 (id: 926043011)

11For if they are ashamed of all that they have done, then reveal to them the design of the house, its details, its exits, its entrances, and all its designs, all its decrees and rules. Then write this down before their eyes so they will keep to all its design and all its rules, so as to obey them.


## Ezekiel 43:12 (id: 926043012)

12This is the regulation for the house: From the peak of the hill to all the surrounding border around it, it will be most holy. Behold! This is the regulation for the house.


## Ezekiel 43:13 (id: 926043013)

13These will be the measurements of the altar in cubits—that cubit being a regular cubit and a handbreadth in length. So the gutter around the altar will be a cubit deep, and its width will also be a cubit. The border around its surrounding edge will be one span. This will be the base of the altar.


## Ezekiel 43:14 (id: 926043014)

14From the gutter at the ground level up to the lower ledge of the altar is two cubits, and that ledge itself is one cubit in width. Then from the small ledge up to the large edge of the altar, it is four cubits, and the large edge is a cubit in width.


## Ezekiel 43:15 (id: 926043015)

15The hearth on the altar for the burnt offerings is four cubits high, and there are four horns pointing upward on the hearth.


## Ezekiel 43:16 (id: 926043016)

16The hearth is twelve cubits in length and twelve cubits in width, a square.


## Ezekiel 43:17 (id: 926043017)

17Its border is fourteen cubits in length and fourteen cubits in width on each of its four sides, and its rim is a half cubit in width. The gutter is a cubit in width all around with its steps facing east.”


## Ezekiel 43:18 (id: 926043018)

18Next he said to me, “Son of man, the Lord Yahweh says this: These are the regulations for the altar on the day they make it, for raising the burnt offering onto it, and for sprinkling blood on it.


## Ezekiel 43:19 (id: 926043019)

19You will give a bull from the cattle as a sin offering for the Levitical priests who are the descendants of Zadok, those who come near to me to serve me—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.


## Ezekiel 43:20 (id: 926043020)

20Then you will take some of its blood and place it on the altar’s four horns and the four sides of its edge and on the surrounding rim; you will cleanse it and make atonement for it.


## Ezekiel 43:21 (id: 926043021)

21Then take the bull for the sin offering and burn it in the appointed part of the temple area outside of the sanctuary.


## Ezekiel 43:22 (id: 926043022)

22Then on the second day you will offer a male goat without blemish from the goats as a sin offering; the priests will cleanse the altar just as they cleansed it with the bull.


## Ezekiel 43:23 (id: 926043023)

23When you finish its cleansing, offer an unblemished bull from the cattle and an unblemished ram from the flock.


## Ezekiel 43:24 (id: 926043024)

24Offer them before Yahweh; the priests will throw salt onto them and raise them up as a burnt offering to Yahweh.


## Ezekiel 43:25 (id: 926043025)

25You must prepare a male goat as a sin offering daily for seven days, and the priests must also prepare an unblemished bull of the cattle and unblemished ram from the flock.


## Ezekiel 43:26 (id: 926043026)

26They must atone for the altar for seven days and purify it, and in this way they must consecrate it.


## Ezekiel 43:27 (id: 926043027)

27They must complete these days, and on the eighth day and onward it will come about that the priests will prepare your burnt offerings and your peace offerings on the altar, and I will accept you—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.”


## Ezekiel 44:1 (id: 926044001)

1Then the man brought me back to the outer sanctuary gate that faced east; it was closed tightly.


## Ezekiel 44:2 (id: 926044002)

2Yahweh said to me, “This gate has been sealed shut; it will not be opened. No man will go through it, for Yahweh, the God of Israel, has come through it, so it has been closed tightly.


## Ezekiel 44:3 (id: 926044003)

3The ruler of Israel will sit in it to eat food before Yahweh. He will enter by way of the gate’s portico and go out the same way.”


## Ezekiel 44:4 (id: 926044004)

4Then he brought me by way of the northern gate to the front of the temple, and I looked, and behold, the glory of Yahweh filled the house of Yahweh, and I fell to my face.


## Ezekiel 44:5 (id: 926044005)

5Then Yahweh said to me, “Son of man, set your heart and look with your eyes and listen with your ears to all that I am declaring to you, to all the statutes of the house of Yahweh and all its regulations. Think about the house’s entrance and exits.


## Ezekiel 44:6 (id: 926044006)

6Then say to the rebellious ones, the house of Israel, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Let all of your disgusting actions be enough for you, house of Israel—


## Ezekiel 44:7 (id: 926044007)

7that you brought foreigners with uncircumcised hearts and uncircumcised flesh to be in my sanctuary, profaning my house, while you were offering me food, fat and blood—you have broken my covenant by all your disgusting actions.


## Ezekiel 44:8 (id: 926044008)

8You have not carried out your duties regarding my holy things, but you appointed others to take up your duties, and you assigned them to care for my holy place.


## Ezekiel 44:9 (id: 926044009)

9The Lord Yahweh says this: No foreigner, uncircumcised in heart and flesh, from any of those who live among the people of Israel, may enter my holy place.


## Ezekiel 44:10 (id: 926044010)

10Yet the Levites went far from me—they wandered away from me, going after their idols—but they will pay for their sin.


## Ezekiel 44:11 (id: 926044011)

11They are servants in my sanctuary, watching the gates of the house and serving in the house and they slaughter the burnt offerings and the people’s sacrifices, and they will stand before the people and serve them.


## Ezekiel 44:12 (id: 926044012)

12But because they performed the sacrifices before their idols, they became stumbling blocks for sin for the house of Israel. Therefore I will lift up my hand to swear an oath against them—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration—they will bear their punishment.


## Ezekiel 44:13 (id: 926044013)

13They will not come near me to act as my priests or to approach any of my holy things, the most holy things. Instead, they will bear their reproach and their guilt for the disgusting actions that they have done.


## Ezekiel 44:14 (id: 926044014)

14But I will place them as keepers of the work in the house, for all of its duties and everything that is done in it.


## Ezekiel 44:15 (id: 926044015)

15Then the Levitical priests, those sons of Zadok who fulfilled the duties of my sanctuary when the people of Israel were wandering away from me—they will come near me to worship me. They will stand before me to offer me the fat and the blood—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.


## Ezekiel 44:16 (id: 926044016)

16They will come to my sanctuary; they will approach my table to worship me and to fulfill their duties to me.


## Ezekiel 44:17 (id: 926044017)

17So it will be that when they come to the gates of the inner courtyard, they will have to dress in linen clothes, for they must not come in wool inside the gates of the courtyard and its house.


## Ezekiel 44:18 (id: 926044018)

18There should be linen turbans on their heads and linen underclothes on their hips. They must not dress in clothes that make them sweat.


## Ezekiel 44:19 (id: 926044019)

19When they go out to the outer courtyard, to the outer courtyard in order to go to the people, they must take off the clothes they wore when they served; they must take them off and lay them down in a holy room, so they do not make other people holy by contact with their special clothing.


## Ezekiel 44:20 (id: 926044020)

20Also they must neither shave their heads nor allow their hair to hang loosely, but they must trim the hair of their heads.


## Ezekiel 44:21 (id: 926044021)

21No priest may drink wine when he comes to the inner court,


## Ezekiel 44:22 (id: 926044022)

22nor take a widow or a divorced woman as a wife for himself, but only a virgin from the line of the house of Israel or a widow who was previously married to a priest.


## Ezekiel 44:23 (id: 926044023)

23For they will teach my people the difference between the holy and the profane; they will make them know the unclean from the clean.


## Ezekiel 44:24 (id: 926044024)

24In a dispute they will stand to judge with my decrees; they must be just. They will keep my law and my statutes in every feast, and they will celebrate my holy Sabbaths.


## Ezekiel 44:25 (id: 926044025)

25They must not defile themselves by going near to a dead person; however, if the dead person was his father or mother, son or daughter, brother or unmarried sister, then they may defile themselves.


## Ezekiel 44:26 (id: 926044026)

26After a priest has become unclean, they will count off a period of seven days for him.


## Ezekiel 44:27 (id: 926044027)

27On the day he enters the holy place, into the inner courtyard to serve in the holy place, he must bring a sin offering for himself—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.


## Ezekiel 44:28 (id: 926044028)

28This will be their inheritance: I am their inheritance, and you must give them no property in Israel; I will be their property!


## Ezekiel 44:29 (id: 926044029)

29They will eat the food offerings, the sin offerings, the guilt offerings, and everything devoted to Yahweh in Israel, will be theirs.


## Ezekiel 44:30 (id: 926044030)

30The best of the firstfruits of all things and every contribution, anything from all of your contributions will belong to the priests, and you will give the first of your dough to the priests so that blessing may rest on your house.


## Ezekiel 44:31 (id: 926044031)

31The priests will not eat any carcass or animal torn by a beast, whether bird or beast.


## Ezekiel 45:1 (id: 926045001)

1When you cast lots to divide up the land as an inheritance, you must make an offering to Yahweh; this offering will be a holy part of the land, twenty\-five thousand cubits in length, and ten thousand cubits in width. It will be holy, all its area round about.


## Ezekiel 45:2 (id: 926045002)

2From this there will be a five hundred cubits by five hundred cubits square surrounding the holy place, with a surrounding border fifty cubits in width.


## Ezekiel 45:3 (id: 926045003)

3From this area you will measure a portion that is twenty\-five thousand cubits in length and ten thousand in width; it will be the sanctuary, the most holy place.


## Ezekiel 45:4 (id: 926045004)

4It will be a holy place in the land for the priests who serve Yahweh, who come near Yahweh to serve him. It will be a place for their houses and a holy area for the holy place.


## Ezekiel 45:5 (id: 926045005)

5So it will be twenty\-five thousand cubits in length and ten thousand in width, and it will be for towns for the Levites who serve in the house.


## Ezekiel 45:6 (id: 926045006)

6You will designate an area for the city, five thousand cubits in width and twenty\-five thousand in length, that will be next to the area reserved for the holy place; this city will belong to all the house of Israel.


## Ezekiel 45:7 (id: 926045007)

7The prince’s land will be on both sides of the area reserved for the holy place and the city. It will be to their west and to their east. The length will correspond to the length of one of those portions, from the west to the east.


## Ezekiel 45:8 (id: 926045008)

8This land will be property for the prince in Israel. My princes will no longer oppress my people; instead, they will give the land to the house of Israel, for their tribes.


## Ezekiel 45:9 (id: 926045009)

9The Lord Yahweh says this: It is enough for you, princes of Israel! Remove violence and strife; do justice and righteousness! Quit your evictions of my people!—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.


## Ezekiel 45:10 (id: 926045010)

10You must have accurate scales, accurate ephahs, and accurate baths!


## Ezekiel 45:11 (id: 926045011)

11The ephah and the bath will be the same amount, so that a bath will be a tenth of a homer; the ephah will be a tenth of a homer. Their measure will be corresponding to the homer.


## Ezekiel 45:12 (id: 926045012)

12The shekel will be twenty gerahs; sixty shekels will make a mina for you.


## Ezekiel 45:13 (id: 926045013)

13This is the contribution that you must present: A sixth of an ephah for every homer of wheat, and you will give a sixth of an ephah for every homer of barley.


## Ezekiel 45:14 (id: 926045014)

14The regulation offering of oil will be a tenth of a bath for every cor (which is ten baths), or for every homer, since a homer is also ten baths.


## Ezekiel 45:15 (id: 926045015)

15One sheep or goat from the flock for every two hundred animals from the watered regions of Israel will be used for any burnt offering or peace offering to make atonement for the people—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.


## Ezekiel 45:16 (id: 926045016)

16All the people of the land will give this contribution to the prince in Israel.


## Ezekiel 45:17 (id: 926045017)

17It will be the prince’s responsibility to furnish animals for the burnt offerings, the grain offerings, and the drink offerings at the festivals and the new moon celebrations, and on the Sabbath days—all the fixed festivals of the house of Israel. He will provide for the sin offerings, the grain offerings, the burnt offerings, and the peace offerings for atonement on behalf of the house of Israel.


## Ezekiel 45:18 (id: 926045018)

18The Lord Yahweh says this: In the first month, on the first day of the month, you will take an unblemished bull from the herd and perform a sin offering for the sanctuary.


## Ezekiel 45:19 (id: 926045019)

19The priest will take some of the blood of the sin offering and place it on the doorposts of the house and on the four corners of the border of the altar, and on the doorposts of the gate to the inner court.


## Ezekiel 45:20 (id: 926045020)

20You will do this on the seventh of the month for each person’s sin by accident or ignorance; in this way you will atone for the temple.


## Ezekiel 45:21 (id: 926045021)

21In the first month on the fourteenth day of the month, there will be for you a festival, a seven\-day festival. You will eat unleavened bread.


## Ezekiel 45:22 (id: 926045022)

22On that day, the prince will prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bull as a sin offering.


## Ezekiel 45:23 (id: 926045023)

23For the seven days of the festival, the prince will prepare a burnt offering for Yahweh: Seven bulls and seven unblemished rams each day for seven days, and a male goat each day as a sin offering.


## Ezekiel 45:24 (id: 926045024)

24Then the prince will perform a food offering of an ephah for each bull and an ephah for each ram with a hin of oil for each ephah.


## Ezekiel 45:25 (id: 926045025)

25In the seventh month on the fifteenth day of the month, at the festival, the prince will perform offerings on these seven days: Sin offerings, burnt offerings, food offerings, and offerings of oil.


## Ezekiel 46:1 (id: 926046001)

1The Lord Yahweh says this: The gate of the inner courtyard, facing east, will be shut for the six days of work, but on the Sabbath it will be opened, and on the day of the new moon it will be opened.


## Ezekiel 46:2 (id: 926046002)

2The prince will enter the outer courtyard by the way of the gate and its portico from outside, and he will stand before the doorposts of the inner gate while the priests perform his burnt offering and peace offering. Then he will worship at the threshold of the inner gate and go out, but the gate will not be shut until evening.


## Ezekiel 46:3 (id: 926046003)

3The people of the land will also worship before Yahweh at the entrance to this gate on the Sabbaths and new moons.


## Ezekiel 46:4 (id: 926046004)

4The burnt offering that the prince offers to Yahweh on the Sabbath day will be six unblemished lambs and an unblemished ram.


## Ezekiel 46:5 (id: 926046005)

5The grain offering with the ram will be an ephah, and the grain offering with the lambs will be what he wishes to give, and a hin of oil with each ephah of grain.


## Ezekiel 46:6 (id: 926046006)

6On the day of the new moon he must offer an unblemished bull from a herd, six lambs, and an unblemished ram.


## Ezekiel 46:7 (id: 926046007)

7He must make a grain offering of an ephah for the bull and an ephah for the ram, and what he wishes to give for the lambs, and a hin of oil for every ephah of grain.


## Ezekiel 46:8 (id: 926046008)

8When the prince enters by the way of the gate and its portico, he must leave by the same way.


## Ezekiel 46:9 (id: 926046009)

9But when the people of the land come before Yahweh at the appointed festivals, anyone entering through the north gate to worship must leave through the south gate; and anyone entering through the south gate must leave through the north gate. No one may turn back to the gate through which he entered, for he must go out straight ahead.


## Ezekiel 46:10 (id: 926046010)

10The prince must be in their midst; when they go in, he must go in, and when they leave, he must leave.


## Ezekiel 46:11 (id: 926046011)

11At the festivals, the grain offering must be an ephah of grain for the bull and an ephah for the ram, and whatever he wishes to give with the lambs, and a hin of oil for every ephah.


## Ezekiel 46:12 (id: 926046012)

12When the prince gives a freewill offering, either a burnt offering or a peace offering to Yahweh, the gate facing east will be opened for him. He will offer his burnt offering or his peace offering as he does it on the Sabbath day. Then he must go out, and after he has gone out the gate will be shut.


## Ezekiel 46:13 (id: 926046013)

13In addition, you will give an unblemished lamb one year old as a burnt offering to Yahweh daily; you will do this morning after morning.


## Ezekiel 46:14 (id: 926046014)

14You will give a grain offering with it morning after morning, a sixth of an ephah and a third of a hin of oil to moisten the flour of the grain offering for Yahweh, according to a permanent statute.


## Ezekiel 46:15 (id: 926046015)

15They will prepare the lamb, the grain offering, and the oil morning after morning, a permanent burnt offering.


## Ezekiel 46:16 (id: 926046016)

16The Lord Yahweh says this: If the prince gives a gift to any of his sons, it is his inheritance. It will be the property of his sons, it is an inheritance.


## Ezekiel 46:17 (id: 926046017)

17But if he gives a gift from his inheritance to one of his servants, then it will be that servant’s until the year of liberty, and then it will return to the prince. His inheritance will certainly be for his sons.


## Ezekiel 46:18 (id: 926046018)

18The prince will not take the people’s inheritance away from their own property; he must provide for his sons from his own property so that my people will not be scattered, each man from his own property.’”


## Ezekiel 46:19 (id: 926046019)

19Next the man brought me through the entrance at the gate to the holy rooms for the priests, which faced north and behold! There was a place toward the west.


## Ezekiel 46:20 (id: 926046020)

20He said to me, “This is the place where the priests must boil the guilt offering and the sin offering and where they must bake the grain offering. They must not bring the offerings into the outer courtyard, for then the people would be consecrated.”


## Ezekiel 46:21 (id: 926046021)

21Then he brought me to the outer courtyard and he led me past the four corners of that courtyard, and I saw that in every corner of the courtyard there was a another court.


## Ezekiel 46:22 (id: 926046022)

22In the four corners of the outer courtyard there were four small courtyards, forty cubits in length and thirty in width. There were the same dimensions for all four of the courtyards.


## Ezekiel 46:23 (id: 926046023)

23There was a row made of stone all around the four of them, and cooking hearths were under the stone row.


## Ezekiel 46:24 (id: 926046024)

24The man said to me, “These are the places where the temple servants will boil the people’s sacrifices.”


## Ezekiel 47:1 (id: 926047001)

1Then the man took me back to the entrance to the temple, and there was water flowing out from under the temple threshold of the house toward the east—for the front of the temple faced east—and the water was flowing down the south side of the temple, to the right of the altar.


## Ezekiel 47:2 (id: 926047002)

2So he brought me out through the northern gate and led me around to the gate facing east, and there the water was flowing from this gate on its south side.


## Ezekiel 47:3 (id: 926047003)

3As the man was going toward the east, there was a measuring line in his hand; he measured off one thousand cubits and brought me through the water to ankle\-deep water.


## Ezekiel 47:4 (id: 926047004)

4Then he measured one thousand cubits again and brought me through the water to knee\-deep water; and he measured another thousand cubits and brought me to hip\-deep water.


## Ezekiel 47:5 (id: 926047005)

5Next he measured off another thousand cubits, but it was a river that I could not cross through because the water had risen and was deep enough to swim in—it was a river that could not be crossed.


## Ezekiel 47:6 (id: 926047006)

6The man said to me, “Son of man, do you see this?” and he brought me out and had me walk back along the riverbank.


## Ezekiel 47:7 (id: 926047007)

7As I walked back, there the riverbank had many trees on this side and also the other side.


## Ezekiel 47:8 (id: 926047008)

8The man said to me, “This water is going out to the eastern territory and down to the Arabah; this water flows into the Salt Sea and will make it fresh.


## Ezekiel 47:9 (id: 926047009)

9It will be that every living creature that swarms will live where the water goes; there will be many fish, for these waters flow there. It will make the salt water fresh. Everything will live wherever the river goes.


## Ezekiel 47:10 (id: 926047010)

10Then it will happen that fishermen of En Gedi will stand by the water, and there will be a place to dry out the fishing nets by En Eglaim. There will be many kinds of fish in the Salt Sea, like the fish in the Great Sea for their abundance.


## Ezekiel 47:11 (id: 926047011)

11But the Salt Sea’s swamps and marshes will not be made fresh; they will be for providing salt.


## Ezekiel 47:12 (id: 926047012)

12Beside this river on its banks, on both sides, all kinds of trees will grow that bear food. Their leaves will not wither and their fruit will never fail to grow. Each month the trees will bear fruit, because the water from the sanctuary flows to them. Their fruit will be for food, and their leaves will be for healing.


## Ezekiel 47:13 (id: 926047013)

13The Lord Yahweh says this: This will be the way that you divide the land up for the twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph will have two portions.


## Ezekiel 47:14 (id: 926047014)

14You are to divide equally what I lifted up my hand and swore to give to your fathers. This land will come to you as an inheritance.


## Ezekiel 47:15 (id: 926047015)

15This will be the boundary of the land on the north side from the Great Sea by way of Hethlon, and then to Zedad.


## Ezekiel 47:16 (id: 926047016)

16Then the boundary will go to Berothah, to Sibraim, which is between Damascus and Hamath, and then to Hazer Hattikon, which is beside the boundary of Hauran.


## Ezekiel 47:17 (id: 926047017)

17So the boundary will go from the sea to Hazar Enan on the border with Damascus and Hamath to the north. This will be the north side.


## Ezekiel 47:18 (id: 926047018)

18On the east side the boundary will run between Hauran and Damascus, along the Jordan River between Gilead and the land of Israel. You will measure from the border to the eastern sea. This will be the eastern border.


## Ezekiel 47:19 (id: 926047019)

19Then on the south side the boundary will run from Tamar as far as the waters of Meribah Kadesh, then along the brook of Egypt to the Great Sea. This will be the boundary on the south side.


## Ezekiel 47:20 (id: 926047020)

20Then the boundary on the west side will be the Great Sea to a point opposite Lebo Hamath. This will be the west side.


## Ezekiel 47:21 (id: 926047021)

21In this way you will divide this land for yourselves, for the tribes of Israel.


## Ezekiel 47:22 (id: 926047022)

22So you will distribute the inheritances for yourselves and for the foreigners in your midst, those who have given birth to children in your midst and who are, with you, like the native born people of Israel. You will cast lots for inheritances among the tribes of Israel.


## Ezekiel 47:23 (id: 926047023)

23Then it will happen that the foreigner will be with the tribe among whom he is living. You must give him an inheritance—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.”


## Ezekiel 48:1 (id: 926048001)

1These are the names of the tribes. The tribe of Dan will receive one portion of land; its boundary will run along the northern boundary of Israel by way of Hethlon and Lebo Hamath. Its boundary will go on to Hazar Enan and along the border with Damascus to the north and then on to Hamath. Dan’s boundary will go from east all the way to the Great Sea.


## Ezekiel 48:2 (id: 926048002)

2Adjoining the border of Dan, from the east side to the west, Asher will have one portion.


## Ezekiel 48:3 (id: 926048003)

7Adjoining the border of Reuben from the east side to the west, Judah will have one portion.


## Ezekiel 48:8 (id: 926048008)

8The offering of land that you will make will be along the border with Judah and extend from the east side to the west side; it will be twenty\-five thousand cubits in width. Its length will correspond to one tribe’s portion from the east side to the west side, and the temple will be in the middle of it.


## Ezekiel 48:9 (id: 926048009)

9This land that you will offer up to Yahweh will be twenty\-five thousand cubits in length and ten thousand cubits in width.


## Ezekiel 48:10 (id: 926048010)

10These will be the assignments of this holy portion of land: The priests will have land assigned to them measuring twenty\-five thousand cubits in length on the north side; ten thousand cubits in width on the west side; ten thousand cubits in width on the east side; and twenty\-five thousand cubits in length on the south side, with the holy place of Yahweh in the middle of it.


## Ezekiel 48:11 (id: 926048011)

11This will be for the consecration of the priests of the line of Zadok, who have served me faithfully and who did not go astray when the people of Israel went astray, as the Levites did.


## Ezekiel 48:12 (id: 926048012)

12The offering for them will be a portion of this most holy land, extending to the border of the Levites.


## Ezekiel 48:13 (id: 926048013)

13The Levites’ land along the border with the priests’ land will be twenty\-five thousand cubits in length and ten thousand cubits in width. The entire length of the two tracts of land will be twenty\-five thousand cubits in length and twenty thousand cubits in width.


## Ezekiel 48:14 (id: 926048014)

14They must not sell it or exchange it; none of this firstfruits of the land of Israel must ever be separated from these tracts, for it all is holy to Yahweh.


## Ezekiel 48:15 (id: 926048015)

15The remaining land, five thousand cubits in width and twenty\-five thousand cubits in length, will be for the collective use of the city, the houses, and the pastureland; the city will be in its midst.


## Ezekiel 48:16 (id: 926048016)

16These will be the city’s measurements: The north side will be 4,500 cubits in length; the south side will be 4,500 cubits in length; the east side will be 4,500 cubits in length; and the west side will be 4,500 cubits in length.


## Ezekiel 48:17 (id: 926048017)

17There will be pasture for the city toward the north, 250 cubits deep; to the south, 250 cubits deep; to the east, 250 cubits deep, and to the west, 250 cubits deep.


## Ezekiel 48:18 (id: 926048018)

18The remaining area of the holy offering will stretch for ten thousand cubits to the east and ten thousand cubits to the west. It will stretch along the border of the holy offering, and its produce will be food for those working in the city.


## Ezekiel 48:19 (id: 926048019)

19The people who work in the city, people belong to all the tribes of Israel, will farm that land.


## Ezekiel 48:20 (id: 926048020)

20All the land offering will measure twenty\-five thousand cubits by twenty\-five thousand cubits. In this way you will make the holy offering of land, together with the land for the city.


## Ezekiel 48:21 (id: 926048021)

21The rest of the land on either side of the holy offering and the city area will be for the prince. The prince’s tract of land to the east will extend for twenty\-five thousand cubits from boundary of the holy offering to the eastern border—and his tract to the west will extend for twenty\-five thousand cubits to the western border. In the middle will be the holy offering, and the holy place of the temple will be in its midst.


## Ezekiel 48:22 (id: 926048022)

22The land extending from the property of the Levites and the area of the city in its midst will be for the prince; it will be between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin—this land will be for the prince.


## Ezekiel 48:23 (id: 926048023)

23As for the remaining tribes, their portions will also run from the eastern side to the west side. Benjamin will receive one portion.

## Ezekiel 48:28 (id: 926048028)

28The southern boundary of Gad will extend from Tamar to the waters of Meribah Kadesh, and farther to the brook of Egypt, and then to the Great Sea.


## Ezekiel 48:29 (id: 926048029)

29This is the land for which you will cast lots; it will be the inheritance of the tribes of Israel. These will be their portions. This is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.


## Ezekiel 48:30 (id: 926048030)

30These will be the exits from the city: On the north side, which will measure 4,500 cubits in length,
