## Job 1:1 (id: 918001001)

1There was a man in the land of Uz. Job was his name, and that man was blameless and righteous, both fearful of God and turning from evil.


## Job 1:2 (id: 918001002)

2Seven sons and three daughters were born to him.


## Job 1:3 (id: 918001003)

3And his stock was 7, 000 sheep and 3, 000 camels and 500 pairs of oxen and 500 donkeys and a very large retinue. And that man was greater than all the sons of the East.


## Job 1:4 (id: 918001004)

4And his sons went and made a feast, a man in {his} house on his day, and they sent and called their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.


## Job 1:5 (id: 918001005)

5And it happened that when the days of the feast had gone around, Job sent and consecrated them. He arose early in the morning and offered burnt offerings {according to} the number of all of them. For Job said, “Perhaps my sons have sinned and blessed God in their hearts.” Thus Job did all the days.


## Job 1:6 (id: 918001006)

6And it was the day, and the sons of God came to present themselves to Yahweh. And the adversary also came in the midst of them.

7And Yahweh said to the adversary, “From where have you come?” And the adversary answered Yahweh and said, “From wandering on the earth and from going back and forth on it.”


## Job 1:8 (id: 918001008)

8And Yahweh said to the adversary, “Have you set your heart upon my servant Job? For {there is} not like him on the earth, a blameless and righteous man, fearful of God and turning from evil.”


## Job 1:9 (id: 918001009)

9And the adversary answered Yahweh and said, “Does Job fear God for nothing?


## Job 1:10 (id: 918001010)

10Have you not put a hedge around him and around his house and around all that {is} his, from every side? You have blessed the works of his hands, and his cattle have burst forth in the land.


## Job 1:11 (id: 918001011)

11However, just stretch out your hand and touch all that {is} his, if he will not bless you to your face.”


## Job 1:12 (id: 918001012)

12And Yahweh said to the adversary, “Behold, all that {is} his {is} in your hand. Only against him do not stretch out your hand.” And the adversary went away from the face of Yahweh.


## Job 1:13 (id: 918001013)

13And it was the day, and his sons and his daughters {were} eating and drinking wine in the house of their eldest brother.

## Job 1:17 (id: 918001017)

## Job 1:18 (id: 918001018)

## Job 1:19 (id: 918001019)

19And behold, a great wind came from across the desert and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young people and they died, and only I alone have escaped to tell you.”


## Job 1:20 (id: 918001020)

20And Job arose and tore his robe and shaved his head and fell to the ground and prostrated himself.


## Job 1:21 (id: 918001021)

## Job 1:22 (id: 918001022)

22In all of this, Job did not sin and he did not ascribe impropriety to God.

3And Yahweh said to the adversary, “Have you set your heart on my servant Job? For there is not like him on the earth, a blameless and righteous man, fearful of God and turning from evil. And still he is holding firmly to his integrity, although you incited me against him, to devour him for nothing.”


## Job 2:4 (id: 918002004)

4And the adversary answered Yahweh and said, “Skin for skin! Indeed, all that {is} to a man, he will give for his life.


## Job 2:5 (id: 918002005)

5However, just stretch out your hand and touch upon his bones and upon his flesh, if he will not bless you to your face.”


## Job 2:6 (id: 918002006)

6And Yahweh said to the adversary, “Behold him in your hand; only spare his life.”

7And the adversary went away from the face of Yahweh, and he struck Job with bad boils from the sole of his foot to his pate.

9And his wife said to him, “{Are} you still holding firmly to your integrity? Bless God and die.”


## Job 2:10 (id: 918002010)

10But he said to her, “Like the speaking of the foolish one, you are speaking. Indeed, will we receive the good from God and not receive the bad?” In all of this, Job did not sin with his lips.


## Job 2:11 (id: 918002011)

11And the three friends of Job heard {that} all this evil had come on him, and they each came from his place, Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite, and they gathered together to come to sympathize with him and to comfort him.


## Job 2:12 (id: 918002012)

12And they raised their eyes from afar and they did not recognize him, and they raised their voice and wept, and they each tore his robe, and they threw dust heavenward upon their heads.


## Job 2:13 (id: 918002013)

13And they sat with him on the ground for seven days and seven nights, and {there was} no speaking a word to him, for they saw that {his} grief was very great.


## Job 3:1 (id: 918003001)

1After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed his day.


## Job 3:2 (id: 918003002)

2Job answered and said,


## Job 3:3 (id: 918003003)

3“May the day on which I was born perish, and the night {that} said, ‘A boy has been conceived.’


## Job 3:4 (id: 918003004)

4That day—may it be dark! May God not seek it from above, and may light not shine upon it.


## Job 3:5 (id: 918003005)

5May darkness and a dark shadow claim it; may a cloud dwell over it; may the blacknesses of the day terrify it.


## Job 3:6 (id: 918003006)

6That night—may gloom take it! May it not rejoice among the days of the year; into the number of the months may it not come.


## Job 3:7 (id: 918003007)

7Behold: That night—may it be barren! May a joyful shout not come into it.


## Job 3:8 (id: 918003008)

8May the ones cursing a day curse it, the ones skillful to awaken Leviathan.


## Job 3:9 (id: 918003009)

9May the stars of its twilight be dark; may it wait for light but {there be} none, and may it not see the eyelids of the dawn,


## Job 3:10 (id: 918003010)

10because it did not close the doors of my womb and hide trouble from my eyes.


## Job 3:11 (id: 918003011)

11Why did I not die from the womb, come out of the belly and expire?


## Job 3:12 (id: 918003012)

12Why did knees welcome me, and why breasts, that I should suck?


## Job 3:13 (id: 918003013)

13For now I had lain down and was reposing, I had slept, then it was being rest to me


## Job 3:14 (id: 918003014)

14with kings and counselors of the earth, the ones having built monuments for themselves,


## Job 3:15 (id: 918003015)

15or with princes, gold {having been} to them, the ones having filled their houses with silver.


## Job 3:16 (id: 918003016)

16Or, like a hidden stillborn child, I might not have been, as infants {sometimes} do not see the light.


## Job 3:17 (id: 918003017)

17There the wicked stop troubling, and there the weary in strength rest.


## Job 3:18 (id: 918003018)

18Captives relax together; they do not hear the voice of a taskmaster.


## Job 3:19 (id: 918003019)

19Small and great {are} there the same, and a servant {is} free from his master.


## Job 3:20 (id: 918003020)

20Why is light given to the miserable, and life to the bitter in soul,


## Job 3:21 (id: 918003021)

21the ones longing for death, but {it is} not to them, and they dig for it more than for hidden treasure,


## Job 3:22 (id: 918003022)

22the ones rejoicing unto gladness, and they celebrate when they find a grave,


## Job 3:23 (id: 918003023)

23to a man whose way is hidden, and God has hedged around him?


## Job 3:24 (id: 918003024)

24For my sighing comes before my food, my groaning flows out like waters.


## Job 3:25 (id: 918003025)

25For I feared a fear and it has arrived with me; what I dreaded has come to me.


## Job 3:26 (id: 918003026)

26I have not relaxed, and I have not reposed, and I have not rested, but trouble comes.”


## Job 4:1 (id: 918004001)

1And Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,


## Job 4:2 (id: 918004002)

2If a word is tried with you, will you tire? But to refrain from a word, who is able?


## Job 4:3 (id: 918004003)

3Behold, you have instructed many, you have strengthened weak hands.


## Job 4:4 (id: 918004004)

4Your words have upheld the one stumbling, and buckling knees you have strengthened.


## Job 4:5 (id: 918004005)

5But now it comes to you and you tire; it touches you and you panic.


## Job 4:6 (id: 918004006)

6{Is} not your fear your confidence, your hope, even the integrity of your ways?


## Job 4:7 (id: 918004007)

7Remember, now: Who, he {being} innocent, has perished? And when were the righteous destroyed?


## Job 4:8 (id: 918004008)

8According to what I have seen, the ones plowing misery and sowing trouble reap it.


## Job 4:9 (id: 918004009)

9By the breath of God they perish, and by the blast of his nose they cease {to be}.


## Job 4:10 (id: 918004010)

10The roar of the lion! The voice of the fierce lion! But the teeth of the young lions are broken.


## Job 4:11 (id: 918004011)

11The strong lion perishes for lack of prey, and the cubs of the lioness are scattered.


## Job 4:12 (id: 918004012)

12Now a word was confided to me, and my ear received a whisper of it.


## Job 4:13 (id: 918004013)

13In troubling thoughts from visions of the night, in the falling of deep sleep upon men,


## Job 4:14 (id: 918004014)

14fear happened to me, and trembling, and it frightened all my bones.


## Job 4:15 (id: 918004015)

15And a spirit was gliding before my face; the hair of my flesh was bristling.


## Job 4:16 (id: 918004016)

16It was standing still, but I was not recognizing its appearance. An image {was} in front of my eyes. {There was} silence, then I heard a voice:


## Job 4:17 (id: 918004017)

17‘Will a man be more righteous than God? If a man will be more pure than his Maker?’


## Job 4:18 (id: 918004018)

18Behold, he does not trust in his servants, and he charges his angels with folly.


## Job 4:19 (id: 918004019)

19How much less dwellers in houses of clay that {have} their foundation in the dust! They crumble them before a moth!

20From morning to evening they are destroyed; they perish forever without {anyone} noticing.

21Is not their tent cord pulled up away from them? They will die, and not in wisdom.


## Job 5:1 (id: 918005001)

1Call out now; is there one answering you? To which of the holy ones will you turn?


## Job 5:2 (id: 918005002)

2For indignation kills the foolish, and resentment kills the one being simple.


## Job 5:3 (id: 918005003)

3I myself have seen the foolish taking root, but right away I cursed his abode.


## Job 5:4 (id: 918005004)

4His children are far from safety, and they are crushed at the gate, and {there is} none rescuing {them},


## Job 5:5 (id: 918005005)

5whose harvest the hungry one devours; they even take it from among the thorns, and the thirsty ones pant for their wealth.


## Job 5:6 (id: 918005006)

6For misery does not come out from the dust, and trouble does not sprout from the ground.


## Job 5:7 (id: 918005007)

7For man is born to trouble, and sons of the flame soar to fly.


## Job 5:8 (id: 918005008)

8But I myself would seek for God, and to God I would commit my cause,


## Job 5:9 (id: 918005009)

9the one doing great {things} and {there is} no searching, marvelous {things} until {there is} no number,


## Job 5:10 (id: 918005010)

10the one giving rain on the face of the earth and sending waters on the face of the fields,


## Job 5:11 (id: 918005011)

11setting the humble on high, and the ones mourning are high in safety,


## Job 5:12 (id: 918005012)

12frustrating the plans of the crafty, and their hands do not accomplish an initiative,


## Job 5:13 (id: 918005013)

13catching the cunning in their craftiness, and the plan of the ones being deceptive is hastened.

3For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas; therefore my words raved.

5Does a wild donkey bray over grass? If an ox bellows over its fodder?

9and may God be willing and may he crush me, may he loose his hand and cut me off!

11What {is} my strength, that I should wait? And what {is} my end, that I should prolong my life?


## Job 6:12 (id: 918006012)

12If my strength {is} the strength of stones? If my flesh {is} bronze?

13If my help {is} not in me, and initiative has been taken away from me?

24Teach me, and I will be silent, and how I have strayed, make me understand.

25How words of uprightness are forceful! But what does correcting from you correct?

1{Is} not hardship to a man on earth? And {are not} his days like the days of a hireling?

2As a slave longs for shade, and as a hireling awaits his wages,

13When I say, ‘My couch will comfort me, my bed will take away my complaint,’

18and you will visit him in the mornings and you will test him in the moments?

19For how long will you not look away from me? Will you not slacken until I swallow my saliva?


## Job 7:20 (id: 918007020)

4as that I was in the days of my prime, when the friendship of God {was} upon my tent,

5when the Almighty {was} still with me, my children around me,


## Job 29:6 (id: 918029006)

## Job 29:7 (id: 918029007)

7When I went out to the gate of the city, {when} I took my seat in the square,

11For the ear heard, and they blessed me, and the eye saw, and they attested me

12because I rescued the afflicted crying out and the fatherless when {there was} no help to him.

19My root is spread out to the waters, and the dew lodges on my branch.


## Job 29:20 (id: 918029020)

20My glory {is} fresh in me, and my bow sprouts in my hand.’


## Job 29:21 (id: 918029021)

21They listened to me and they waited, and they kept silent for my counsel.


## Job 29:22 (id: 918029022)

22After my word, they did not also {speak}, for my speech dripped on them.

23And they waited for me as {for} rain, and they opened their mouth {as} for the latter rain.

3{They are} gaunt from poverty and from hunger, ones gnawing the dry land yesterday {in} waste and desolation,

4ones plucking mallow among the brush, and the root of broom trees {is} their bread.


## Job 30:5 (id: 918030005)

5They are driven out from the midst; they shout after them as {after} a thief,

6to dwell on the slope of wadis, {in} holes of the dust and rocks.


## Job 30:7 (id: 918030007)

10They abhor me, they stay away from me, but from my face they do not withhold spit.

11For he has loosed my cord and humbled me, so they cast away restraint from my face.

12On {my} right the brood arise; they thrust aside my foot, and they pile up roads of destruction against me.


## Job 30:13 (id: 918030013)

13They destroy my path, they advance my calamity; {there is} no help for them.


## Job 30:14 (id: 918030014)

14As {through} a wide breach they come; amid the ruin they roll on.


## Job 30:15 (id: 918030015)

15Terrors are turned against me; {each} one pursues my dignity like the wind, and my deliverance passes away like a cloud.


## Job 30:16 (id: 918030016)

16And now my life pours itself out within me; days of affliction seize me.

17Night pierces my bones from upon me, and the ones gnawing me do not rest.

18By great force my clothing is changed; it binds me like the collar of my tunic.

19He has thrown me into the mud, and I have become like dust and ashes.


## Job 30:20 (id: 918030020)

20I cry to you, but you do not answer me; I stand, but you gaze at me.

21You have changed to {be} cruel to me; with the strength of your hand you attack me.


## Job 30:22 (id: 918030022)

22You lift me up on the wind; you make me ride on it, and you toss me about {in} a storm.


## Job 30:23 (id: 918030023)

23For I know you are bringing me {to} death and {to} the house of appointment to all the living.


## Job 30:24 (id: 918030024)

24Nevertheless, does not one in a heap stretch out a hand? If in his trouble he does {not} therefore cry out?


## Job 30:25 (id: 918030025)

25If I did not weep for the difficult of day? My soul grieved for the needy.

27My innards are boiled and they do not rest; days of affliction confront me.

29I have become a brother to jackals and a companion to the daughters of clamor.

31So my harp is to mourning and my flute to the sound of ones weeping.

1I have cut a covenant with my eyes; how then would I gaze upon a virgin?

2For what {would be} the portion from God above, or the inheritance from the Almighty in the heights?


## Job 31:3 (id: 918031003)

3{Is} not calamity for the unrighteous and disaster for doers of wickedness?

4Does he not see my ways and count all my steps?


## Job 31:5 (id: 918031005)

5If I have walked with falsehood or my foot has hurried to deceit—


## Job 31:6 (id: 918031006)

6let him weigh me in balances of righteousness, and God will know my integrity—


## Job 31:7 (id: 918031007)

7if my step has turned aside from the way, or my heart has gone after my eyes, or a spot has stuck to my hands,


## Job 31:8 (id: 918031008)

8let me sow and may another eat, or may my crops be uprooted!


## Job 31:9 (id: 918031009)

9If my heart has been opened by a woman and I have lurked at the door of my neighbor,

10may my wife grind for another, and may others bow down upon her.


## Job 31:11 (id: 918031011)

11For that {would be} lewdness, and it would be iniquity of judges.


## Job 31:12 (id: 918031012)

12For it {is} a fire, it consumes unto Abaddon, and it would uproot all of my harvest.


## Job 31:13 (id: 918031013)

13If I disdained the justice of my male servant or my female servant in their case against me,


## Job 31:14 (id: 918031014)

14then what would I do if God arose? Or if he visited, how would I answer him?


## Job 31:15 (id: 918031015)

15Did not the one making me in the belly make him? And did {not} one fashion us in the womb?


## Job 31:16 (id: 918031016)

16If I have withheld from the desire of the poor, or I have made the eyes of the widow fail,


## Job 31:17 (id: 918031017)

17or I have eaten my morsel alone and the fatherless did not eat from it—


## Job 31:18 (id: 918031018)

18for from my youth he has grown up with me as a father, and from the belly of my mother I have guided her.


## Job 31:19 (id: 918031019)

19If I have seen one perishing from lack of clothing or {that} there was not a covering for the needy,


## Job 31:20 (id: 918031020)

20if his loins have not blessed me and he has {not} warmed himself from the wool of my sheep,


## Job 31:21 (id: 918031021)

21if I have shaken my hand against the fatherless because I saw my help at the gate,


## Job 31:22 (id: 918031022)

22may my upper arm fall from the shoulder blade; yes, may my arm be broken from its socket!


## Job 31:23 (id: 918031023)

23For the destruction of God {was} a dread to me, and from his majesty, I was not able.


## Job 31:24 (id: 918031024)

24If I have made gold my hope and I have said to fine gold, ‘My confidence’;


## Job 31:25 (id: 918031025)

25if I have rejoiced because my wealth {was} great and because my hand had acquired much!


## Job 31:26 (id: 918031026)

26If I have seen the light when it shone or the moon walking {in} splendor,


## Job 31:27 (id: 918031027)

27and my heart opened in secret and my hand kissed my mouth,


## Job 31:28 (id: 918031028)

28this also {would be} iniquity of judges, for I would have denied God above.


## Job 31:29 (id: 918031029)

29If I have rejoiced at the destruction of one hating me or lifted myself up because evil found him!


## Job 31:30 (id: 918031030)

30For I have not caused my palate to sin by asking {for} his life with a curse.


## Job 31:31 (id: 918031031)

31If the men of my tent have not said, ‘Who will give one {who} has not been satisfied from his flesh?’!


## Job 31:32 (id: 918031032)

32The sojourner has not stayed overnight in the outdoors; I have opened my doors to the traveler.


## Job 31:33 (id: 918031033)

33If, like man, I have concealed my sins by hiding my guilt in my chest,


## Job 31:34 (id: 918031034)

34because I feared the great multitude and the contempt of the clans terrified me, and I kept silent, I did not go out the door!


## Job 31:35 (id: 918031035)

35Who will give to me one hearing me? Behold, my mark! May the Almighty answer me! And the scroll that the man of my case has written?


## Job 31:36 (id: 918031036)

36If I would not bear it on my shoulder? I would bind it to me {as} crowns!


## Job 31:37 (id: 918031037)

37I would declare to him an account of my steps; I would approach him like a noble.


## Job 31:38 (id: 918031038)

38If my soil cries out against me and its furrows weep together,


## Job 31:39 (id: 918031039)

39if I have eaten its yield without silver or caused the breath of its masters to expire,


## Job 31:40 (id: 918031040)

40may a thorn grow instead of wheat and a weed instead of barley!” The words of Job have ended.


## Job 32:1 (id: 918032001)

1And the three of these men ceased from answering Job, because he {was} righteous in his eyes.


## Job 32:2 (id: 918032002)

2Then the nose burned of Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite, from the clan of Ram. His nose burned against Job upon him declaring himself righteous rather than God.


## Job 32:3 (id: 918032003)

3And against the three of his friends his nose burned upon that they had not found an answer but they had declared Job wrong.


## Job 32:4 (id: 918032004)

4Now Elihu had awaited Job with words, because they {were} older in days than he {was}.


## Job 32:5 (id: 918032005)

5But Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouths of the three of the men, and his nose burned.


## Job 32:6 (id: 918032006)

6And Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite answered and said, “I {am} young in days and you {are} aged. Upon that, I was timid and I was afraid of telling you my knowledge.


## Job 32:7 (id: 918032007)

7I said, ‘Let days speak, and let a multitude of years teach wisdom.’


## Job 32:8 (id: 918032008)

8Nevertheless, a spirit, it {is} in man, and the breath of the Almighty gives them understanding.


## Job 32:9 (id: 918032009)

9The great are not wise, and the aged do {not} understand justice.


## Job 32:10 (id: 918032010)

10Therefore I say, ‘Listen to me; I also will declare my knowledge.’


## Job 32:11 (id: 918032011)

11Behold, I waited for your words; I listened to your reasonings while you searched {for} words.


## Job 32:12 (id: 918032012)

12Indeed, I paid attention to you, but behold, there was no one proving Job wrong, {not one} of you answering his words,


## Job 32:13 (id: 918032013)

13lest you say, ‘We have found wisdom!’ Let God refute him, not man.


## Job 32:14 (id: 918032014)

14Now he has not arrayed words against me, and I will not answer him with your words.


## Job 32:15 (id: 918032015)

15They are dismayed; they do not answer any longer; words have gone from them.


## Job 32:16 (id: 918032016)

16Shall I wait because they are not speaking, because they stand, they answer no more?


## Job 32:17 (id: 918032017)

17I also will answer {on} my part; I also will declare my knowledge.


## Job 32:18 (id: 918032018)

18For I am full of words; the spirit in my belly compels me.


## Job 32:19 (id: 918032019)

19Behold, my belly {is} like wine {that} has no vent; like new wineskins, it is bursting open.


## Job 32:20 (id: 918032020)

20I will speak and refresh myself; I will open my lips and answer.


## Job 32:21 (id: 918032021)

21Now let me not lift the face of a man, and let me not give a title to a man.


## Job 32:22 (id: 918032022)

22For I do not know giving titles; my Maker would soon take me away.


## Job 33:1 (id: 918033001)

1But now, Job, please hear my words; yes, listen to all of my words.


## Job 33:2 (id: 918033002)

2Behold, I have now opened my mouth; my tongue has spoken on my palate.


## Job 33:3 (id: 918033003)

3My words {are} {from} the uprightness of my heart, and my lips speak pure knowledge.


## Job 33:4 (id: 918033004)

4The Spirit of God made me; yes, the breath of the Almighty enlivened me.


## Job 33:5 (id: 918033005)

5If you can, answer me; array to my face; station yourself.


## Job 33:6 (id: 918033006)

6Behold, I am for God according to your mouth. I too have been formed from clay;


## Job 33:7 (id: 918033007)

7behold, my fear will not terrify you, and my pressure will not be heavy on you.


## Job 33:8 (id: 918033008)

8Indeed, you have spoken in my ears, and I have heard the sound of the words.


## Job 33:9 (id: 918033009)

9‘I {am} pure, without transgression; I {am} innocent, and iniquity {is} not to me.


## Job 33:10 (id: 918033010)

10Behold, he finds occasions against me; he considers me an enemy to him.


## Job 33:11 (id: 918033011)

11He puts my feet in shackles; he watches all of my paths.’


## Job 33:12 (id: 918033012)

12Behold, {in} this you are not right. I will answer you, for God is greater than man.


## Job 33:13 (id: 918033013)

13Why do you contend against him, that he does not answer any of one’s words?


## Job 33:14 (id: 918033014)

14For God speaks once—yes, twice; one does not perceive it.


## Job 33:15 (id: 918033015)

15In a dream, in a vision of the night, in the falling of deep sleep upon men, in slumbers upon a bed,


## Job 33:16 (id: 918033016)

16then he opens the ear of men and seals their correction


## Job 33:17 (id: 918033017)

17to bring a man back from {his} doing and to conceal pride from a man.


## Job 33:18 (id: 918033018)

18He spares his soul from the pit and his life from crossing over by a weapon.


## Job 33:19 (id: 918033019)

19He is also chastened with pain on his bed and the contention of his bones {is} continual.


## Job 33:20 (id: 918033020)

20so his life abhors bread, and his soul food of desire.


## Job 33:21 (id: 918033021)

21His flesh wastes from sight, and his bones, not seen, are exposed,


## Job 33:22 (id: 918033022)

22and his soul draws near to the pit, and his life to the ones causing death.


## Job 33:23 (id: 918033023)

23If there is an angel for him, an interpreter, one of a thousand, to declare to a man his uprightness,


## Job 33:24 (id: 918033024)

24and he is gracious to him and says, ‘Redeem him from going down to the pit, I have found a ransom,’


## Job 33:25 (id: 918033025)

25his flesh becomes fresher than {in} childhood; it returns to the days of his youth.


## Job 33:26 (id: 918033026)

26He will pray to God, and he will accept him, and he will see his face with joy, and he will restore to the man his righteousness.


## Job 33:27 (id: 918033027)

27He will sing to men and say, ‘I sinned and I turned aside uprightness, but he did not requite to me.


## Job 33:28 (id: 918033028)

28He has redeemed my soul from going over into the pit, and my life will see light.’


## Job 33:29 (id: 918033029)

29Behold, God does all these {things} twice, thrice, with a man


## Job 33:30 (id: 918033030)

30to bring his soul back from the pit for being enlightened with the light of the living.


## Job 33:31 (id: 918033031)

31Heed, Job; listen to me. Be silent, and I will speak.


## Job 33:32 (id: 918033032)

32If there are words, answer me; speak, for I desire to justify you.


## Job 33:33 (id: 918033033)

33If not, you listen to me; be silent, and I will teach you wisdom.


## Job 34:1 (id: 918034001)

1And Elihu answered and said,


## Job 34:2 (id: 918034002)

2“Hear my words, wise {ones}, and listen to me, ones knowing.


## Job 34:3 (id: 918034003)

3For the ear tests words, and the palate tastes food.


## Job 34:4 (id: 918034004)

4Let us choose justice for ourselves; let us know among ourselves what is good.


## Job 34:5 (id: 918034005)

5For Job has said, ‘I am righteous, but God has taken away my justice.


## Job 34:6 (id: 918034006)

6Would I lie about my justice? My arrow is incurable, without transgression.’


## Job 34:7 (id: 918034007)

7What man {is} like Job? He drinks scorn like water,


## Job 34:8 (id: 918034008)

8and he travels in company with doers of iniquity and walks with men of wickedness!


## Job 34:9 (id: 918034009)

9For he has said, ‘It does not benefit a man when he delights {himself} with God.’


## Job 34:10 (id: 918034010)

10Therefore, men of heart, listen to me: Sacrilege to God from wickedness, and the Almighty from iniquity!


## Job 34:11 (id: 918034011)

11For the deed of a man he repays to him, and according to the path of a man, he causes it to find him.


## Job 34:12 (id: 918034012)

12Indeed, God truly does not act wickedly, and the Almighty does not pervert justice.


## Job 34:13 (id: 918034013)

13Who appointed {him} over the earth? And who set the world, all of it?


## Job 34:14 (id: 918034014)

14If he set his heart upon himself, {if} he gathered his Spirit and his breath to himself,


## Job 34:15 (id: 918034015)

15all flesh would expire together, and man would return to the dust.


## Job 34:16 (id: 918034016)

16But if understanding, hear this; listen to the sound of my words.


## Job 34:17 (id: 918034017)

17Will one hating justice indeed govern? Or if you will condemn the Righteous {One}, the Mighty {One},


## Job 34:18 (id: 918034018)

18the one saying ‘Worthless!’ to a king, ‘Wicked!’ {to} nobles,


## Job 34:19 (id: 918034019)

19who does not lift the faces of princes and does not acknowledge the rich to the face of the poor, for all of them {are} the work of his hands.


## Job 34:20 (id: 918034020)

20{In} a moment they die, and {in} the middle of the night people are shaken and they pass, and they take away the mighty, not by a hand.

22There is no darkness and there is no deep darkness for the doers of iniquity to be hidden there.

23For he does not set upon a man further, to go to God for judgment.


## Job 34:24 (id: 918034024)

24He shatters the mighty {with} no investigation, and he establishes others instead of them.

25Because he regards their deeds, he overthrows {them} in the night, and they are crushed.


## Job 34:26 (id: 918034026)

26He strikes them for their wickednesses in the place of the ones seeing,

28to cause the cry of the poor to come to him, and he heard the cry of the lowly.


## Job 34:29 (id: 918034029)

30from the reigning of a godless man, from snares of the people.


## Job 34:31 (id: 918034031)

31If one says to God, ‘I have borne, I will not offend,


## Job 34:32 (id: 918034032)

32besides \[what] I see, you teach me; if I have done iniquity, I will not continue,’


## Job 34:33 (id: 918034033)

33from with you will he repay it? Since you despise, then you will choose and not I. So what you know, speak.


## Job 34:34 (id: 918034034)

34Men of heart will say to me, and a man of wisdom hearing me,


## Job 34:35 (id: 918034035)

35‘Job does not speak with knowledge, and his words {are} not with understanding.’


## Job 34:36 (id: 918034036)

36If only Job were tested to the end upon {his} answers among men of iniquity.

37For he adds transgression to his sin; he claps among us, and he multiplies his words against God.”


## Job 35:1 (id: 918035001)

1And Elihu answered and said,


## Job 35:2 (id: 918035002)

2“Do you consider this to {be} justice? You say, ‘I am more righteous than God’!


## Job 35:3 (id: 918035003)

3For you have said, ‘What does it benefit you? What do I gain more than my sin?’


## Job 35:4 (id: 918035004)

4I will answer you {with} words, and your friends with you.


## Job 35:5 (id: 918035005)

5Observe the heavens and see, and look, the clouds soar above you.


## Job 35:6 (id: 918035006)

6If you sin, what do you accomplish against him? Or {if} your transgressions multiply, what do you do to him?


## Job 35:7 (id: 918035007)

7If you are righteous, what do you give to him, or what does he receive from your hand?


## Job 35:8 (id: 918035008)

8Your wickedness {is} to a man like you, and your righteousness {is} to a son of man.


## Job 35:9 (id: 918035009)

9From the multitude of oppressions they make a cry; they shout from the arm of the mighty.


## Job 35:10 (id: 918035010)

10But one does not say, ‘Where is God my Maker, the one giving songs in the night,


## Job 35:11 (id: 918035011)

11the one teaching us more than the beasts of the earth, making us wiser than the birds of the heavens?’


## Job 35:12 (id: 918035012)

12There they cry out, but he does not answer from the face of the pride of evil {ones}.


## Job 35:13 (id: 918035013)

13Surely God does not hear vanity, and the Almighty does not regard it.


## Job 35:14 (id: 918035014)

14How much less that you say you do not see him, the case {is} to his face, and you are waiting for him,


## Job 35:15 (id: 918035015)

15and now that {in} his nose, he does not visit, and he does not take much notice of transgression!


## Job 35:16 (id: 918035016)

16So Job opens his mouth {in} vain; without knowledge, he multiplies words.”


## Job 36:1 (id: 918036001)

1And Elihu continued and said,


## Job 36:2 (id: 918036002)

2“Be patient with me a little and I will show you, for \[there are} yet words to God.


## Job 36:3 (id: 918036003)

3I will carry my knowledge to from afar, and I will attribute righteousness to my Maker.

4For truly my words {will} not {be} false; the complete in knowledge {is} with you.

5Behold, God {is} mighty, and he does not despise; mighty, strong in heart.


## Job 36:6 (id: 918036006)

6He does not keep the wicked alive, but he gives the lowly justice.

7He does not withdraw his eyes from the righteous, but he sets them on a throne with kings forever, and they rise high.


## Job 36:8 (id: 918036008)

8But if {they are} bound in chains and they are caught in cords of affliction,


## Job 36:9 (id: 918036009)

9then he declares to them their deeds and their transgressions, for they magnified themselves,


## Job 36:10 (id: 918036010)

10and he opens their ear to correction and says that they shall return from iniquity.


## Job 36:11 (id: 918036011)

11If they hear and serve {him}, they will complete their days in good and their years in pleasantness.


## Job 36:12 (id: 918036012)

12But if they do not hear, they will cross over by a weapon, and they will expire as without knowledge.


## Job 36:13 (id: 918036013)

13And the godless of heart keep the nose; they do not cry out when he binds them.

14Their soul dies in youth, and their life {is} among the cultic prostitutes.

15He delivers the afflicted by his affliction, and he opens their ear by oppression.


## Job 36:16 (id: 918036016)

16And indeed, he has drawn you from the mouth of distress {to} a broad place {with} no constriction under it, and the setting of your table he has filled {with} fatness.


## Job 36:17 (id: 918036017)

17But you are full of the judgment of the wicked; judgment and justice take hold.


## Job 36:18 (id: 918036018)

18For wrath, lest it entice you into clapping, and the greatness of a ransom will not deliver you.


## Job 36:19 (id: 918036019)

19Will he esteem your riches? Not gold or all of the strengths of wealth!

20Do not desire the night, {which is} to the departing of peoples {from} their place.

21Watch yourself, do not turn to sin, for you have chosen upon that rather than affliction.

22Behold, God causes to be high in his power. Who {is} a teacher like him?

23Who has appointed his way to him? Or who has said, ‘You have committed unrighteousness?’


## Job 36:24 (id: 918036024)

24Remember that you magnify his work, which men have sung.


## Job 36:25 (id: 918036025)

25Every man has looked upon it; man has regarded from afar.


## Job 36:26 (id: 918036026)

26Behold, God {is} great, but we do not know {him}; the number of his years, indeed, {there is} no searching.


## Job 36:27 (id: 918036027)

27For he draws up the drops of water; they distill {as} rain into his stream,


## Job 36:28 (id: 918036028)

28which the clouds pour down; they drop upon man {in} abundance.


## Job 36:29 (id: 918036029)

29Indeed, if one will understand the spread of the cloud, the thunder from his hut?

30Behold, he spreads his lightning upon it, and he covers the roots of the sea.

1Indeed, my heart trembles at this, and it leaps from its place.


## Job 37:2 (id: 918037002)

2Hearing, hear the roar of his voice and the sound {that} comes from his mouth!

3He lets it loose under all of the heavens, and his lightning to the edges of the earth.

4A voice roars after it; he thunders with the voice of his majesty, and he does not restrain them when his voice is heard.


## Job 37:5 (id: 918037005)

5God thunders marvelously with his voice, doing great {things} and we do not know.

6For he says to the snow, ‘Be {on} the earth,’ and {to} the shower of rain, {to} the shower of rains, ‘Strength!’

16Do you know about the balancing of the cloud, the wonders of the perfect in knowledges?


## Job 37:17 (id: 918037017)

17{You} whose garments {are} hot in the quieting of the earth from the south,

18will you hammer out the sky with him, strong as a cast mirror?

13for taking hold of the edges of the earth, and the wicked are shaken from it?


## Job 38:14 (id: 918038014)

2Will you number the months they will fulfill? Or will you know the time of their bearing?

15and it forgets that a foot might crush it and a beast of the field might trample it.


## Job 39:16 (id: 918039016)

16It treats its sons harshly, as if not to it; vain {is} its labor, without fear,
