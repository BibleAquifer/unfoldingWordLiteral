9And Yahweh spoke to Gad, the seer of David, saying,


## 1 Chronicles 21:10 (id: 913021010)

10“Go and speak to David, saying, ‘Thus says Yahweh, three I am stretching over you; choose for yourself one from them, and I will act towards you.’”


## 1 Chronicles 21:11 (id: 913021011)

11And Gad came to David, and he said to him, “Thus says Yahweh, ‘Take for yourself:


## 1 Chronicles 21:12 (id: 913021012)

12either three years famine, or three months being swept away from the faces of your foes and overtaken by the sword of your enemies, or three days of the sword of Yahweh, even pestilence in the land and the angel of Yahweh destroying in all the territory of Israel.’ And now, see; what word shall I bring back to the one who sent me?”


## 1 Chronicles 21:13 (id: 913021013)

13And David said to Gad, “There is great distress to me! Please let me fall into the hand of Yahweh, for many are his great mercies, but into the hand of man, do not let me fall.”


## 1 Chronicles 21:14 (id: 913021014)

14And Yahweh gave a pestilence on Israel, and from Israel fell 70,000 men.


## 1 Chronicles 21:15 (id: 913021015)

15And God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy her. And when destroying, Yahweh saw, and he relented concerning the disaster. And he said to the angel who was destroying, “Enough! Now release your hand.” And the angel of Yahweh was standing at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.


## 1 Chronicles 21:16 (id: 913021016)

16And David lifted his eyes and saw the angel of Yahweh standing between the earth and between the heavens and his sword drawn in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. And David fell, and the elders, covered in sackcloth, on their faces.


## 1 Chronicles 21:17 (id: 913021017)

17And David said to God, “Was it not I myself who said to count the people? And it is I who sinned, and I have surely done evil, but these sheep, what have they done? Yahweh my God, please let your hand be against me and against the house of my father, but not on your people a plague.”


## 1 Chronicles 21:18 (id: 913021018)

18And the angel of Yahweh said to Gad to say to David that David should go up to raise an altar to Yahweh at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.


## 1 Chronicles 21:19 (id: 913021019)

19So David went up at the word of Gad who spoke in the name of Yahweh.


## 1 Chronicles 21:20 (id: 913021020)

20And Ornan turned, and he saw the angel. And four of his sons with him were hiding themselves. And Ornan was threshing wheat.


## 1 Chronicles 21:21 (id: 913021021)

21And David came to Ornan. And Ornan looked, and he saw David. And he went out from the threshing floor, and he bowed down to David, face to the ground.


## 1 Chronicles 21:22 (id: 913021022)

22And David said to Ornan, “Give to me the place of the threshing floor, and I will build on it an altar to Yahweh. At the full price give it to me, so the plague may be restrained from against the people.”


## 1 Chronicles 21:23 (id: 913021023)

23And Ornan said to David, “Take for yourself that my lord the king may do good in his eyes. See, I give the cattle for the burnt offerings and the threshing sledges for wood, and the wheat for the offering; all I give.”


## 1 Chronicles 21:24 (id: 913021024)

24And King David said to Ornan, “No, for I will surely buy at the full price, for I will not lift up what is yours to Yahweh and offer a burnt offering without paying compensation.”


## 1 Chronicles 21:25 (id: 913021025)

25And David gave to Ornan for the place 600 shekels of gold by weight.


## 1 Chronicles 21:26 (id: 913021026)

26And David built there an altar to Yahweh and he offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. And he called to Yahweh, and he answered him with fire from the heavens on the altar of the burnt offering.


## 1 Chronicles 21:27 (id: 913021027)

27And Yahweh spoke to the angel, and he returned his sword to its sheath.


## 1 Chronicles 21:28 (id: 913021028)

28At that time, when David saw that Yahweh had answered him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.


## 1 Chronicles 21:29 (id: 913021029)

29And the tabernacle of Yahweh which Moses made in the wilderness and the altar of the burnt offering at that time were at the high place at Gibeon.


## 1 Chronicles 21:30 (id: 913021030)

30And David was not able to go to its face to seek God, for he was terrified from the faces of the sword of the angel of Yahweh.


## 1 Chronicles 22:1 (id: 913022001)

1And David said, “This is the house of Yahweh God, and this is the altar for the burnt offering of Israel.”


## 1 Chronicles 22:2 (id: 913022002)

2And David said to gather the foreigners who were in the land of Israel. And he assigned stonemasons to hew out cut stones to build the house of God.

4And trees of cedar without number, for the Sidonians and the Tyrians brought a large amount of cedar trees to David.


## 1 Chronicles 22:5 (id: 913022005)

5And David said, “Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house to be built for Yahweh must be great for the sake of a name and for beauty in all the lands. I will now prepare for it.” And David prepared a large amount before the face of his death.


## 1 Chronicles 22:6 (id: 913022006)

6And he called for Solomon his son, and he commanded him to build a house for Yahweh, the God of Israel.


## 1 Chronicles 22:7 (id: 913022007)

7And David said to Solomon, “My son, it was with my heart to build a house myself for the name of Yahweh my God.


## 1 Chronicles 22:8 (id: 913022008)

8But the word of Yahweh was to me, saying, ‘A large amount of blood you have shed and great wars you have made; you shall not build a house for my name because a large amount of blood you have shed on the ground before my face.


## 1 Chronicles 22:9 (id: 913022009)

9Behold, a son is being born to you; he himself will be a man of rest. And I will give rest to him from all his enemies from all around. For Solomon will be his name, and peace and quietness I will give to Israel in his days.


## 1 Chronicles 22:10 (id: 913022010)

10He himself will build a house for my name. And he himself will be to me a son, and I to him a father. And I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel as far as forever.’


## 1 Chronicles 22:11 (id: 913022011)

11Now, my son, may Yahweh be with you, and may you be successful and build a house of Yahweh your God, just as he spoke concerning you.


## 1 Chronicles 22:12 (id: 913022012)

12Only may Yahweh give to you insight and understanding, and give you charge over Israel so that you may keep the law of Yahweh your God.


## 1 Chronicles 22:13 (id: 913022013)

13Then you will succeed, if you are careful to do the statutes and the judgments which Yahweh commanded Moses concerning Israel. Be strong and courageous. Do not fear and do not be dismayed.


## 1 Chronicles 22:14 (id: 913022014)

14Now, see, in my affliction, I have prepared for the house of Yahweh gold talents, 100,000, and silver, 1,000,000 talents, and for bronze and for iron, there is no weighing, for there is a large amount. And trees and stones I have prepared. And to them you will add.


## 1 Chronicles 22:15 (id: 913022015)

15And with you is a large amount of doers of work: stonemasons, and craftsmen of stone and wood, and all wise in all work,

16for gold, for silver, and for bronze, and for iron; there is no numbering. Arise and work. And may Yahweh be with you.”


## 1 Chronicles 22:17 (id: 913022017)

17And David commanded all the chiefs of Israel to help Solomon his son,


## 1 Chronicles 22:18 (id: 913022018)

18“Is not Yahweh your God with you all and given rest to you all from all around? For he has given into my hand the inhabitants of the land, and the land is subdued before the face of Yahweh and before the faces of his people.


## 1 Chronicles 22:19 (id: 913022019)

19Now, give your heart and your life to seek Yahweh your God, and arise and build the sanctuary of Yahweh God to bring the Box of the covenant of Yahweh and the sacred items of God to the house to be built for the name of Yahweh.”


## 1 Chronicles 23:1 (id: 913023001)

1And David was old and was full of days, and he made Solomon his son king over Israel.


## 1 Chronicles 23:2 (id: 913023002)

2And he gathered all the chiefs of Israel and the priests and the Levites.

3And the Levites were counted from sons of 30 years and upward and the numbering was by their heads, by males, 38, 000\.


## 1 Chronicles 23:4 (id: 913023004)

4“From these, to lead the work of the house of Yahweh, 24,000, and officers and judges, 6,000,
