## 1 Timothy 1:1 (id: 954001001)

1Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the command of God our Savior and of the Lord Jesus Christ our hope,


## 1 Timothy 1:2 (id: 954001002)

2to Timothy, a genuine child in the faith. Grace, mercy, peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.


## 1 Timothy 1:3 (id: 954001003)

3Just as I, going into Macedonia, urged you to remain in Ephesus so that you can command certain ones not to teach differently


## 1 Timothy 1:4 (id: 954001004)

4and not to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which promote arguments rather than the stewardship of God, {which is} by faith—.


## 1 Timothy 1:5 (id: 954001005)

5Now the goal of the command is love from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith,


## 1 Timothy 1:6 (id: 954001006)

6from which some, having missed the mark, have turned away to foolish talk,


## 1 Timothy 1:7 (id: 954001007)

7wanting to be teachers of the law, not understanding neither what they are saying nor what they insist on.


## 1 Timothy 1:8 (id: 954001008)

8But we know that the law (is) good if one uses it lawfully,


## 1 Timothy 1:9 (id: 954001009)

9knowing this, that the law is not laid down for the righteous but for the lawless and the rebellious, the ungodly and the sinful, the unholy and the profane, father\-killers and mother\-killers, man\-slayers,


## 1 Timothy 1:10 (id: 954001010)

10the sexually immoral, homosexuals, kidnappers, liars, perjurers, and if anything else is contrary to the healthy teaching,


## 1 Timothy 1:11 (id: 954001011)

11according to the gospel of the glory of the blessed God, with which I have been entrusted.


## 1 Timothy 1:12 (id: 954001012)

12I have gratitude to the one having strengthened me, Christ Jesus our Lord, because he considered me trustworthy, placing {me} into service,


## 1 Timothy 1:13 (id: 954001013)

13formerly being a blasphemer and a persecutor and an insolent {one}, but I was shown mercy because, not knowing, I acted in unfaithfulness.


## 1 Timothy 1:14 (id: 954001014)

14But the grace of our Lord overflowed with faith and love {that are} in Christ Jesus.


## 1 Timothy 1:15 (id: 954001015)

15This word {is} trustworthy and worthy of all acceptance, “Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners”—of whom I am first.


## 1 Timothy 1:16 (id: 954001016)

16But because of this I was shown mercy so that in me, the first, Jesus Christ might demonstrate all patience as an example for the ones about to believe in him for eternal life.


## 1 Timothy 1:17 (id: 954001017)

17Now to the King of the ages, immortal, invisible, the only God, {be} honor and glory forever {and} ever. Amen.


## 1 Timothy 1:18 (id: 954001018)

18This command I am placing before you, my child, Timothy, according to the earlier prophecies about you, that in them you might fight the good fight,


## 1 Timothy 1:19 (id: 954001019)

19having faith and a good conscience, which some, having rejected, have shipwrecked regarding the faith,


## 1 Timothy 1:20 (id: 954001020)

20of whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have given over to Satan so that they may be taught not to blaspheme.


## 1 Timothy 2:1 (id: 954002001)

1I urge, therefore, first of all, for requests, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings to be made for all men,


## 1 Timothy 2:2 (id: 954002002)

2for kings and all the ones being in authority, so that we may live a peaceful and quiet life in all godliness and dignity.


## 1 Timothy 2:3 (id: 954002003)

3This {is} good and acceptable before God our Savior,


## 1 Timothy 2:4 (id: 954002004)

4who desires all men to be saved and to come to knowledge of the truth.


## 1 Timothy 2:5 (id: 954002005)

5For {there is} one God, and one mediator of God and of men—the man Christ Jesus,


## 1 Timothy 2:6 (id: 954002006)

6the one having given himself {as} a ransom for all, the testimony in its own times,


## 1 Timothy 2:7 (id: 954002007)

7for which I was made a herald and an apostle—I am speaking the truth in Christ, I am not lying—a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.


## 1 Timothy 2:8 (id: 954002008)

8Therefore, I want the men in every place to pray, lifting up holy hands without anger and argument;


## 1 Timothy 2:9 (id: 954002009)

9likewise women to adorn themselves in proper attire, with modesty and self\-control, not in braids and gold, or pearls, or very expensive clothing,


## 1 Timothy 2:10 (id: 954002010)

10but—what is proper for women professing godliness—through good works.


## 1 Timothy 2:11 (id: 954002011)

11Let a woman learn in quietness, in all submission.


## 1 Timothy 2:12 (id: 954002012)

12But I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man, but to be in quietness.


## 1 Timothy 2:13 (id: 954002013)

13For Adam was formed first, then Eve,


## 1 Timothy 2:14 (id: 954002014)

14and Adam was not deceived, but the woman, having been deceived, came into transgression.


## 1 Timothy 2:15 (id: 954002015)

15But she will be saved through childbearing if they remain in faith and love and holiness with self\-control.


## 1 Timothy 3:1 (id: 954003001)

1This word {is} trustworthy: “If someone aspires to overseership, he desires a good work.”


## 1 Timothy 3:2 (id: 954003002)

2Therefore, it is necessary for the overseer to be irreproachable, a husband of one wife, temperate, self\-controlled, proper, hospitable, able to teach,


## 1 Timothy 3:3 (id: 954003003)

3not addicted to wine, not a brawler, but gentle, peaceable, not money\-loving,


## 1 Timothy 3:4 (id: 954003004)

4leading his own household well, having children in submission with all dignity,


## 1 Timothy 3:5 (id: 954003005)

5(but if someone does not know {how} to lead his own household, how will he take care of the church of God?),


## 1 Timothy 3:6 (id: 954003006)

6not a new convert, so that he may not fall, being puffed up, into the judgment of the devil.


## 1 Timothy 3:7 (id: 954003007)

7But it is also necessary to have a good testimony from the ones outside, so that he may not fall into reproach and a trap of the devil.


## 1 Timothy 3:8 (id: 954003008)

8Likewise deacons {must be} dignified, not double\-talkers, not indulging in much wine, not greedy,


## 1 Timothy 3:9 (id: 954003009)

9having the mystery of the faith with a pure conscience.


## 1 Timothy 3:10 (id: 954003010)

10But let them also be tested first; then let them serve, being blameless.


## 1 Timothy 3:11 (id: 954003011)

11Likewise women {must be} dignified, not slanderers, temperate, trustworthy in everything.


## 1 Timothy 3:12 (id: 954003012)

12Let deacons be husbands of one wife, leading children and their own households well.


## 1 Timothy 3:13 (id: 954003013)

13For the ones having served well acquire for themselves good standing and much confidence in the faith {that is} in Christ Jesus.


## 1 Timothy 3:14 (id: 954003014)

14I am writing these things to you—hoping to come to you in quickness,


## 1 Timothy 3:15 (id: 954003015)

15but if I delay—so that you may know how it is necessary to behave in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, a pillar and support of the truth.


## 1 Timothy 3:16 (id: 954003016)

16And admittedly great is the mystery of godliness: “Who was revealed in flesh, was justified in the Spirit, was seen by angels, was proclaimed among the nations, was believed in the world, was taken up in glory.”


## 1 Timothy 4:1 (id: 954004001)

1Now the Spirit says specifically that in later times some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceiving spirits and teachings of demons,


## 1 Timothy 4:2 (id: 954004002)

2in the hypocrisy of liars, having been seared {in} their own conscience,


## 1 Timothy 4:3 (id: 954004003)

3forbidding to marry, to abstain from foods that God created for receiving with thanksgiving by {the ones} faithful and knowing the truth.


## 1 Timothy 4:4 (id: 954004004)

4For every creation of God {is} good, and nothing being received with thanksgiving {is} to be rejected,


## 1 Timothy 4:5 (id: 954004005)

5for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.


## 1 Timothy 4:6 (id: 954004006)

6Placing these things before the brothers, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, being nourished by the words of the faith and of the good teaching that you have followed.


## 1 Timothy 4:7 (id: 954004007)

7But reject the profane and old\-womanish myths, but train yourself for godliness,


## 1 Timothy 4:8 (id: 954004008)

8for bodily training is useful for little, but godliness is useful for all, having promise of life, now and coming.


## 1 Timothy 4:9 (id: 954004009)

9The word {is} trustworthy and worthy of all acceptance.


## 1 Timothy 4:10 (id: 954004010)

10For unto this we toil and struggle, that we have hoped in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of believers.


## 1 Timothy 4:11 (id: 954004011)

11Command and teach these things.


## 1 Timothy 4:12 (id: 954004012)

12Let no one despise your youth, but be an example for the believers in word, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity.


## 1 Timothy 4:13 (id: 954004013)

13Until I come, attend to the reading, to the exhortation, to the teaching.


## 1 Timothy 4:14 (id: 954004014)

14Do not neglect the gift in you, which was given to you through prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the council of elders.


## 1 Timothy 4:15 (id: 954004015)

15Practice these things, be in these things, so that your progress may be apparent to all.


## 1 Timothy 4:16 (id: 954004016)

16Pay attention to yourself and to the teaching. Continue in them, for, doing this, you will save both yourself and the ones hearing you.


## 1 Timothy 5:1 (id: 954005001)

1Do not rebuke an older man, but exhort {him} as a father, younger men as brothers,


## 1 Timothy 5:2 (id: 954005002)

2older women as mothers, younger women as sisters, in all purity.


## 1 Timothy 5:3 (id: 954005003)

3Honor widows—real widows.


## 1 Timothy 5:4 (id: 954005004)

4But if any widow has children or grandchildren, first let them learn to treat their own household in a godly way and to make repayment to their forebears, for this is acceptable before God.


## 1 Timothy 5:5 (id: 954005005)

5But the real widow and one having been left alone has hoped in God and remains in requests and prayers night and day.


## 1 Timothy 5:6 (id: 954005006)

6But the one living self\-indulgently, living, has died.


## 1 Timothy 5:7 (id: 954005007)

7Command these things also so that they may be irreproachable.


## 1 Timothy 5:8 (id: 954005008)

8But if someone does not provide for his own, and especially for household members, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.


## 1 Timothy 5:9 (id: 954005009)

9Let a widow be enrolled, not less than 60 years old, having been a wife of one husband,


## 1 Timothy 5:10 (id: 954005010)

10being testified in good works: if she has raised children, if she has received strangers, if she has washed the feet of the saints, if she has aided the afflicted, if she has followed every good work.


## 1 Timothy 5:11 (id: 954005011)

11But reject younger widows, for when they indulge themselves against Christ, they want to marry,


## 1 Timothy 5:12 (id: 954005012)

12having judgment because they have annulled the first faith.


## 1 Timothy 5:13 (id: 954005013)

13But at the same time, they also learn to be idle, wandering about the houses, and not only idle, but also babblers and meddlers, saying what they should not.


## 1 Timothy 5:14 (id: 954005014)

14Therefore, I want younger ones to marry, to bear children, to manage a household, to give no opportunity for reviling to the one opposing.


## 1 Timothy 5:15 (id: 954005015)

15For already some have turned away after Satan.


## 1 Timothy 5:16 (id: 954005016)

16If any believing woman has widows, let her aid them, and let the church not be weighed down, so that it may aid the real widows.


## 1 Timothy 5:17 (id: 954005017)

17Let the elders having led well be considered worthy of double honor, especially the ones toiling in word and teaching.


## 1 Timothy 5:18 (id: 954005018)

18For the Scripture says, “You will not muzzle an ox threshing,” and, “The worker {is} worthy of his wages.”


## 1 Timothy 5:19 (id: 954005019)

19Against an elder, do not receive an accusation unless on two or three witnesses.


## 1 Timothy 5:20 (id: 954005020)

20The ones sinning, rebuke before all, so that the rest also may have fear.


## 1 Timothy 5:21 (id: 954005021)

21I declare before God and Christ Jesus and the chosen angels that you should keep these things without prejudgment, doing nothing according to partiality.


## 1 Timothy 5:22 (id: 954005022)

22Place hands hastily on no one, nor share in the sins of others. Keep yourself pure.


## 1 Timothy 5:23 (id: 954005023)

23No longer drink only water, but use a little wine because of your stomach and your frequent illnesses.


## 1 Timothy 5:24 (id: 954005024)

24The sins of some men are evident, going ahead into judgment, but also they follow after some.


## 1 Timothy 5:25 (id: 954005025)

25Likewise, also the good works {are} evident, and the ones having otherwise are not able to be hidden.


## 1 Timothy 6:1 (id: 954006001)

1As many as are slaves under a yoke, let them consider their own masters worthy of all honor, so that the name of God and the teaching may not be blasphemed.


## 1 Timothy 6:2 (id: 954006002)

2But the ones having believing masters, let them not despise {them} because they are brothers, but rather, let them serve {them} because the ones taking the benefaction are believers and beloved. Teach and urge these things.


## 1 Timothy 6:3 (id: 954006003)

3If anyone is teaching differently and does not come to the healthy words, the ones of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the teaching according to godliness,


## 1 Timothy 6:4 (id: 954006004)

4he is puffed up, understanding nothing, but being sick with controversies and battles about words, from which come envy, strife, blasphemies, evil suspicions,


## 1 Timothy 6:5 (id: 954006005)

5constant friction of men having been corrupted {in} the mind and having been deprived of the truth, considering godliness to be a means of gain.


## 1 Timothy 6:6 (id: 954006006)

6But godliness with contentment is great gain.


## 1 Timothy 6:7 (id: 954006007)

7For we brought nothing into the world, that neither are we able to take anything out.


## 1 Timothy 6:8 (id: 954006008)

8But having food and covering, with these we will be satisfied.


## 1 Timothy 6:9 (id: 954006009)

9But the ones wanting to be rich fall into temptation and a trap and many foolish and harmful desires, whatever sinks men into ruin and destruction.


## 1 Timothy 6:10 (id: 954006010)

10For a root of all the evils is the love of money, which desiring, some have been led away from the faith and have pierced themselves with many sorrows.


## 1 Timothy 6:11 (id: 954006011)

11But you, O man of God, flee these things, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance, gentleness.


## 1 Timothy 6:12 (id: 954006012)

12Fight the good fight of the faith, grasp eternal life, to which you were called and {for which} you confessed the good confession before many witnesses.


## 1 Timothy 6:13 (id: 954006013)

13I command you before God, the one making all alive, and Christ Jesus, the one having testified the good confession before Pontius Pilate,


## 1 Timothy 6:14 (id: 954006014)

14that you keep the commandment spotless, irreproachable, until the appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ,


## 1 Timothy 6:15 (id: 954006015)

15which in its own times the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of the ones reigning and Lord of the ones ruling, will reveal,


## 1 Timothy 6:16 (id: 954006016)

16the only One having immortality, dwelling {in} unapproachable light, whom no one of men has seen, nor is able to see, to whom {be} honor and eternal power. Amen.


## 1 Timothy 6:17 (id: 954006017)

17Command the rich in the present age not to be proud, nor to hope in the uncertainty of riches, but in God, the one providing us all things richly for enjoyment,


## 1 Timothy 6:18 (id: 954006018)

18to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous, willing to share,


## 1 Timothy 6:19 (id: 954006019)

19storing up for themselves a good foundation for what is coming, so that they may grasp the real life.


## 1 Timothy 6:20 (id: 954006020)

20O Timothy, guard the deposit, turning away from the profane, empty sayings and oppositions of falsely\-named knowledge,


## 1 Timothy 6:21 (id: 954006021)

21which some, professing, have missed the mark concerning the faith. Grace {be} with you.
