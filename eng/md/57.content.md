## Philemon 1:1 (id: 957001001)

1Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and our brother Timothy to Philemon, the beloved and our fellow worker,


## Philemon 1:2 (id: 957001002)

2and to Apphia our sister, and to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house.


## Philemon 1:3 (id: 957001003)

3Grace to you and peace from God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ.


## Philemon 1:4 (id: 957001004)

4I always thank my God, making mention of you in my prayers,


## Philemon 1:5 (id: 957001005)

5hearing of your love and the faith that you have in the Lord Jesus and for all the saints,


## Philemon 1:6 (id: 957001006)

6that the fellowship of your faith may become effective through the knowledge of everything good {that is} among us for Christ.


## Philemon 1:7 (id: 957001007)

7For I had much joy and comfort because of your love, because the inner parts of the saints are being refreshed by you, brother.


## Philemon 1:8 (id: 957001008)

8Therefore, having much boldness in Christ to command you the {thing that} is proper {to do},


## Philemon 1:9 (id: 957001009)

9because of love I appeal to you instead—being such a one as Paul, an elder, and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus.


## Philemon 1:10 (id: 957001010)

10I am appealing to you on behalf of my child Onesimus, whom I have fathered in my chains.


## Philemon 1:11 (id: 957001011)

11The one formerly useless to you, but now useful both to you and to me,


## Philemon 1:12 (id: 957001012)

12whom I have sent back to you—him—this one is my inner parts;


## Philemon 1:13 (id: 957001013)

13whom I desired to keep with me, so that he might serve me on behalf of you in the chains of the gospel.


## Philemon 1:14 (id: 957001014)

14But I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that your good {deed} might not be as according to compulsion but according to good will.


## Philemon 1:15 (id: 957001015)

15For perhaps because of this he was separated from {you} for an hour, so that you might have him back forever,


## Philemon 1:16 (id: 957001016)

16no longer as a slave, but better than a slave—a beloved brother, especially to me, but much more so to you, in both the flesh and in the Lord.


## Philemon 1:17 (id: 957001017)

17Therefore, if you have me {as} a partner, receive him as me.


## Philemon 1:18 (id: 957001018)

18But if he has wronged you or owes {you} anything, charge that to me.


## Philemon 1:19 (id: 957001019)

19I, Paul, wrote this with my own hand. I myself will pay it back—in order not to say to you that you also owe me even your own self!


## Philemon 1:20 (id: 957001020)

20Yes, brother, may I benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my inner parts in Christ.


## Philemon 1:21 (id: 957001021)

21Having become confident in your obedience, I wrote to you, having known that you will do even beyond what I am saying.


## Philemon 1:22 (id: 957001022)

22But at the same time, also prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through your prayers I will be given back to you.


## Philemon 1:23 (id: 957001023)

23Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,


## Philemon 1:24 (id: 957001024)

24Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, {and} Luke, my fellow workers.


## Philemon 1:25 (id: 957001025)

25The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ {be} with your spirit. Amen.
