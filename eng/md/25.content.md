## Lamentations 1:2 (id: 925001002)

2She weeps excessively in the night and her tears are on her cheeks. Of all her lovers, no one brings her comfort. All her friends betrayed her. They have become for her enemies.


## Lamentations 1:3 (id: 925001003)

## Lamentations 1:7 (id: 925001007)

7Jerusalem remembers the days of her affliction and her homelessness, all her treasures which were from former days. When her people fell into the hand of the adversary and there was no one to help her, the adversaries saw her. They laughed over her destruction.

## Lamentations 1:20 (id: 925001020)

20Look, O Yahweh, for I am engulfed; my stomach churns, my heart is undone within me, for I have disobeyed grievously. From the outside, the sword makes a barren womb inside a house like death.


## Lamentations 1:21 (id: 925001021)

21Hear, for I am groaning. There is no comforter for me. All my enemies heard my trouble. They rejoiced that you did it. You brought about the day you declared. Yet, may they become like me.

## Lamentations 2:7 (id: 925002007)

13What can I testify to you? To what can I compare you, O daughter of Jerusalem? To what can I liken you, that I may comfort you, O virgin daughter of Zion? For your brokenness is as great as the sea. Who can heal you?


## Lamentations 2:14 (id: 925002014)

## Lamentations 2:20 (id: 925002020)

## Lamentations 2:22 (id: 925002022)
