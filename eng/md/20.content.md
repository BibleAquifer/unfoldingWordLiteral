11and you groan at your end when your flesh and your body are finished.


## Proverbs 5:12 (id: 920005012)

12And you will say, “How I hated correction and my heart despised rebuke!


## Proverbs 5:13 (id: 920005013)

13And I did not listen to the voice of my teachers and to my instructors, I did not incline my ear.

## Proverbs 5:18 (id: 920005018)

18May your fountain be blessed, and be glad because of the wife of your youth!


## Proverbs 5:19 (id: 920005019)

19A doe of loves and a mountain goat of grace, may her breasts drench you on every occasion; may you continually stagger in her love.


## Proverbs 5:20 (id: 920005020)

20And why would you stagger, my son, with a strange woman, or embrace the bosom of a foreign woman?


## Proverbs 5:21 (id: 920005021)

21For in front of the eyes of Yahweh {are} the ways of a man, and all of his paths he observes.


## Proverbs 5:22 (id: 920005022)

22His iniquities capture him, the wicked one; and by the cords of his sin he is grasped.


## Proverbs 5:23 (id: 920005023)

23He will die because there is no correction; and in the abundance of his folly he staggers.


## Proverbs 6:1 (id: 920006001)

1My son, if you pledge for your neighbor, you clasp your palms for a stranger,


## Proverbs 6:2 (id: 920006002)

2you are ensnared by the sayings of your mouth, you are caught by the sayings of your mouth,


## Proverbs 6:3 (id: 920006003)

3then do this, my son, and rescue yourself: Since you have come into the palm of your neighbor, go, humble yourself, and press your neighbor.

6Go to the ant, lazy one! See its ways and be wise,


## Proverbs 6:7 (id: 920006007)

7which, without a commander, officer, or ruler for it,


## Proverbs 6:8 (id: 920006008)

8prepares its bread in the summer; it gathers its food in the harvest.


## Proverbs 6:9 (id: 920006009)

9Until when, lazy one, will you lie down? When will you rise from your sleep?


## Proverbs 6:10 (id: 920006010)

10“A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to lie down”—


## Proverbs 6:11 (id: 920006011)

11and your poverty will come like one who walks and your lack like a man of shield.


## Proverbs 6:12 (id: 920006012)

12A man of worthlessness, a man of iniquity, {is} one who walks {with} perversity of mouth,


## Proverbs 6:13 (id: 920006013)

13one who winks with his eye, one who rubs with his foot, one who points with his fingers.


## Proverbs 6:14 (id: 920006014)

14Perverse things {are} in his heart, plotting evil on every occasion; he sends forth quarrels.


## Proverbs 6:15 (id: 920006015)

15Therefore his calamity will come instantly, suddenly he will be broken and without healing.


## Proverbs 6:16 (id: 920006016)

16Six {are} they Yahweh hates, and seven {are} abominations to his self:


## Proverbs 6:17 (id: 920006017)

17uplifted eyes, a tongue of falsehood, and hands pouring out innocent blood,


## Proverbs 6:18 (id: 920006018)

18a heart devising plans of iniquity, feet hurrying to run to evil,


## Proverbs 6:19 (id: 920006019)

19a witness of falsehood who breathes out lies and who sends forth quarrels between brothers.


## Proverbs 6:20 (id: 920006020)

20Guard, my son, the commandment of your father and do not forsake the law of your mother.


## Proverbs 6:21 (id: 920006021)

21Bind them on your heart continually; tie them around your neck.


## Proverbs 6:22 (id: 920006022)

22When you walk about, it will guide you; when you lie down, it will preserve you; and you will wake up, it will converse with you.


## Proverbs 6:23 (id: 920006023)

23For the commandment {is} a lamp and the law {is} a light, and the rebukes of instruction {are} the way of life,


## Proverbs 6:24 (id: 920006024)

24to keep you from a woman of evil, from the smoothness of the tongue of a foreign woman.


## Proverbs 6:25 (id: 920006025)

25Do not desire her beauty in your heart and do not let her take you with her eyelashes.


## Proverbs 6:26 (id: 920006026)

26For the price of a prostitute woman {is} as a loaf of bread, but the wife of a man hunts a precious life.


## Proverbs 6:27 (id: 920006027)

27Could a man carry a fire on his chest and his clothes not be burned?


## Proverbs 6:28 (id: 920006028)

28If a man walks on coals then will his feet not be scorched?


## Proverbs 6:29 (id: 920006029)

29So is the one going to the wife of his neighbor: Every one who touches her will not remain blameless.


## Proverbs 6:30 (id: 920006030)

30They do not despise the thief if he steals to satisfy his appetite when he is hungry.


## Proverbs 6:31 (id: 920006031)

31But if he is found, he must repay sevenfold; all the wealth of his house he must give.


## Proverbs 6:32 (id: 920006032)

32One who commits adultery {with} a woman {is} lacking of heart; destroying his life, he does it.


## Proverbs 6:33 (id: 920006033)

33He will find a wound and disgrace and his shame will not be wiped out.


## Proverbs 6:34 (id: 920006034)

34For jealousy is the heat of a man, and he will not spare in the day of vengeance.
