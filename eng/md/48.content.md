## Galatians 1:1 (id: 948001001)

1Paul, an apostle—not from men nor through man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, the one having raised him from the dead—


## Galatians 1:2 (id: 948001002)

2and all the brothers with me, to the churches of Galatia:


## Galatians 1:3 (id: 948001003)

3Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ,


## Galatians 1:4 (id: 948001004)

4the one having given himself for our sins so that he might deliver us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,


## Galatians 1:5 (id: 948001005)

5to whom {be} the glory forever {and} ever. Amen.


## Galatians 1:6 (id: 948001006)

6I am amazed that you are turning away so quickly to a different gospel from the one having called you in the grace of Christ,


## Galatians 1:7 (id: 948001007)

7which is not another, except there are certain ones causing you trouble and wanting to pervert the gospel of Christ.


## Galatians 1:8 (id: 948001008)

8But even if we or an angel from heaven might proclaim to you a gospel other than the one we proclaimed to you, let him be cursed.


## Galatians 1:9 (id: 948001009)

9As we have said before, and now I say again, “If anyone proclaims to you a gospel other than the one you received, let him be cursed.”


## Galatians 1:10 (id: 948001010)

10For am I now trying to persuade men, or God? Or am I seeking to please men? If I were still pleasing men, I would not be a servant of Christ.


## Galatians 1:11 (id: 948001011)

11For I make known to you, brothers, that the gospel having been proclaimed by me is not according to man.


## Galatians 1:12 (id: 948001012)

12For neither I did receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but by revelation of Jesus Christ.


## Galatians 1:13 (id: 948001013)

13For you have heard about my former manner of life in Judaism, that I was persecuting the church of God beyond measure, and I was destroying it.


## Galatians 1:14 (id: 948001014)

14And I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of the same age among my race, being far more zealous for the traditions of my fathers.


## Galatians 1:15 (id: 948001015)

15But when the one having set me apart from the womb of my mother and having called {me} through his grace was pleased


## Galatians 1:16 (id: 948001016)

16to reveal his Son in me, so that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with flesh and blood,


## Galatians 1:17 (id: 948001017)

17nor did I go up to Jerusalem to the ones {being} apostles before me. Instead, I went to Arabia and again returned to Damascus.


## Galatians 1:18 (id: 948001018)

18Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas and I stayed with him fifteen days.


## Galatians 1:19 (id: 948001019)

19But I did not see any of the other apostles except James, the brother of the Lord.


## Galatians 1:20 (id: 948001020)

20Now what I write to you, behold, before God, I am not lying.


## Galatians 1:21 (id: 948001021)

21Then I went to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.


## Galatians 1:22 (id: 948001022)

22Now I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea {that are} in Christ.


## Galatians 1:23 (id: 948001023)

23But they were only hearing, “The one formerly persecuting us is now proclaiming the faith which he formerly was destroying,”


## Galatians 1:24 (id: 948001024)

24and they were glorifying God in me.


## Galatians 2:1 (id: 948002001)

1Then after 14 years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, also taking Titus along with {me}.


## Galatians 2:2 (id: 948002002)

2Now I went up according to a revelation and set before them the gospel that I proclaim among the Gentiles, but privately to the ones seeming to be important, lest I might run—or had run—in vain.


## Galatians 2:3 (id: 948002003)

3But not even Titus, the one with me, being a Greek, was forced to be circumcised.


## Galatians 2:4 (id: 948002004)

4But it was because of the secretly brought in false brothers, who came in secretly to spy on our freedom that we have in Christ Jesus so that they will enslave us,


## Galatians 2:5 (id: 948002005)

5we did not even yield in submission to them for an hour, so that the truth of the gospel might remain with you.


## Galatians 2:6 (id: 948002006)

6But from the ones seeming to be something (what sort they were formerly matters nothing to me; God does not accept the face of man)—for, the ones seeming important added nothing to me.


## Galatians 2:7 (id: 948002007)

7But on the contrary, having seen that I had been entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcision, just as Peter to the circumcision


## Galatians 2:8 (id: 948002008)

8(for the one having worked in Peter for apostleship to the circumcision also worked in me to the Gentiles),


## Galatians 2:9 (id: 948002009)

9and having understood the grace having been given to me, James and Cephas and John, the ones seeming to be pillars, gave the right hand of fellowship to Barnabas and me, so that we to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcision,


## Galatians 2:10 (id: 948002010)

10only that we should continue to remember the poor, this same thing that I was also eager to do.


## Galatians 2:11 (id: 948002011)

11But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he stood condemned.


## Galatians 2:12 (id: 948002012)

12For before certain ones came from James, he was eating with the Gentiles. But when they came, he was withdrawing and was separating himself, being afraid of the ones from the circumcision.


## Galatians 2:13 (id: 948002013)

13And the rest of the Jews also joined with him, so that even Barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy.


## Galatians 2:14 (id: 948002014)

14But when I saw that they were not walking correctly according to the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas in front of all {of them}, “If you, being a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you force the Gentiles to live like Jews?


## Galatians 2:15 (id: 948002015)

15We {are} Jews by birth, and not sinners from the Gentiles;


## Galatians 2:16 (id: 948002016)

16but knowing that no man is justified by works of the law except through faith in Jesus Christ, we also believed in Christ Jesus so that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law. For by works of the law not any flesh will be justified.


## Galatians 2:17 (id: 948002017)

17But if, seeking to be justified in Christ, we ourselves were also found {to be} sinners, {is} Christ then a minister of sin? May it never be!


## Galatians 2:18 (id: 948002018)

18For if I again rebuild those things which I destroyed, I prove myself to be a transgressor.


## Galatians 2:19 (id: 948002019)

19For I, through the law, died to the law so that I might live to God. I have been crucified with Christ,


## Galatians 2:20 (id: 948002020)

20and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. And that which I now live in the flesh, I live by faith that {is in} the Son of God, the one having loved me and having given himself for me.


## Galatians 2:21 (id: 948002021)

21I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness {is} through the law, then Christ died for nothing!”


## Galatians 3:1 (id: 948003001)

1O foolish Galatians! Who bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed {as} crucified?


## Galatians 3:2 (id: 948003002)

2I want to learn only this from you: Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law or by hearing of faith?


## Galatians 3:3 (id: 948003003)

3Are you so foolish? Having begun by Spirit, are you now finishing by flesh?


## Galatians 3:4 (id: 948003004)

4Have you experienced so many things for nothing—if indeed it was really for nothing?


## Galatians 3:5 (id: 948003005)

5Therefore, the one providing the Spirit to you and working miracles among you, {is it} by works of the law, or by hearing of faith?


## Galatians 3:6 (id: 948003006)

6Just as Abraham “believed God and it was credited to him as righteousness,”


## Galatians 3:7 (id: 948003007)

7know, then, that the ones by faith, these are sons of Abraham.


## Galatians 3:8 (id: 948003008)

8And the Scripture, having foreseen that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, “In you all the nations will be blessed.”


## Galatians 3:9 (id: 948003009)

9So then, the ones by faith are blessed along with the believing Abraham.


## Galatians 3:10 (id: 948003010)

10For as many as are of works of the law are under a curse; for it is written, “Cursed {is} everyone who does not abide by all the things written in the Book of the Law to do them.”


## Galatians 3:11 (id: 948003011)

11Now, that no one is justified before God by the law {is} clear, because “The righteous will live by faith.”


## Galatians 3:12 (id: 948003012)

12Now the law is not by faith, but, “The one doing these things will live in them.”


## Galatians 3:13 (id: 948003013)

13Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse on behalf of us—for it is written, “Cursed {is} everyone hanging on a tree”—


## Galatians 3:14 (id: 948003014)

14so that the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, so that through faith we might receive the promise of the Spirit.


## Galatians 3:15 (id: 948003015)

15Brothers, I speak according to man. Nevertheless, no one sets aside or adds to a covenant established by man.


## Galatians 3:16 (id: 948003016)

16Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. He does not say, “and to seeds,” as to many, but as to one, “and to your seed,” who is Christ.


## Galatians 3:17 (id: 948003017)

17Now I say this: The law, having come after 430 years, does not set aside the covenant previously established by God to nullify the promise.


## Galatians 3:18 (id: 948003018)

18For if the inheritance {is} from the law, {it is} no longer from promise. But God has graciously given {it} to Abraham through a promise.


## Galatians 3:19 (id: 948003019)

19Why, then, the law? It was added because of transgressions, having been put into effect through angels by the hand of a mediator until the seed would come to whom the promise had been made.


## Galatians 3:20 (id: 948003020)

20Now a mediator is not for one, but God is one.


## Galatians 3:21 (id: 948003021)

21Therefore {is} the law against the promises? May it never be! For if a law was given being able to make alive, {then} truly righteousness would have come by the law.


## Galatians 3:22 (id: 948003022)

22But the Scripture imprisoned all things under sin so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to the ones believing.


## Galatians 3:23 (id: 948003023)

23Now before the faith came, we were held captive under the law, imprisoned until the faith about to be revealed.


## Galatians 3:24 (id: 948003024)

24So the law became our guardian until Christ, so that we might be justified by faith.


## Galatians 3:25 (id: 948003025)

25But faith having come, we are no longer under a guardian.


## Galatians 3:26 (id: 948003026)

26For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.


## Galatians 3:27 (id: 948003027)

27For as many as have been baptized into Christ put on Christ.


## Galatians 3:28 (id: 948003028)

28There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.


## Galatians 3:29 (id: 948003029)

29Now if you {are} of Christ, then you are seed of Abraham, heirs according to promise.


## Galatians 4:1 (id: 948004001)

1Now I say, for as much time as the heir is a child, he is no different from a slave, being master of all.


## Galatians 4:2 (id: 948004002)

2But he is under guardians and stewards until the date appointed by his father.


## Galatians 4:3 (id: 948004003)

3So also, when we were children, we were being enslaved under the elemental principles of the world.


## Galatians 4:4 (id: 948004004)

4But when the fullness of time came, God sent forth his Son, having been born from a woman, having been born under the law,


## Galatians 4:5 (id: 948004005)

5in order that he might redeem the ones under the law, so that we might receive the adoption as sons.


## Galatians 4:6 (id: 948004006)

6And because you are sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying out, “Abba, Father.”


## Galatians 4:7 (id: 948004007)

7So then, you are no longer a slave, but a son, and if a son, also an heir through God.


## Galatians 4:8 (id: 948004008)

8But at that time, not having known God, you were enslaved to the ones by nature not being gods.


## Galatians 4:9 (id: 948004009)

9But now, having come to know God, or rather, having come to be known by God, how are you turning again to the weak and worthless elemental principles to which once more you want to be enslaved again?


## Galatians 4:10 (id: 948004010)

10You observe days and months and seasons and years!


## Galatians 4:11 (id: 948004011)

11I am afraid for you lest I have labored among you for nothing.


## Galatians 4:12 (id: 948004012)

12I beg you, brothers, become as I am, because I also {became} as you {are}. You did me no harm.


## Galatians 4:13 (id: 948004013)

13Now you know that because of a weakness of the flesh I proclaimed the gospel to you previously.


## Galatians 4:14 (id: 948004014)

14And you did not despise your trial in my flesh nor reject me, but you welcomed me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus.


## Galatians 4:15 (id: 948004015)

15Where, then, {is} your blessing? For I testify to you that, if possible, having torn out your eyes, you would have given {them} to me.


## Galatians 4:16 (id: 948004016)

16So then, speaking truth to you, have I become your enemy?


## Galatians 4:17 (id: 948004017)

17They are zealous for you, not rightly, but they desire to separate you so that you would be zealous for them.


## Galatians 4:18 (id: 948004018)

18But {it is} good to be zealous for good at all times and not only when I am present with you.


## Galatians 4:19 (id: 948004019)

19My children, with whom I am in labor again until Christ would be formed in you—


## Galatians 4:20 (id: 948004020)

20but I am desiring to be present with you now and to change my tone, because I am perplexed about you.


## Galatians 4:21 (id: 948004021)

21Tell me, you desiring to be under the law, do you not listen to the law?


## Galatians 4:22 (id: 948004022)

22For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave girl and one by the free woman.


## Galatians 4:23 (id: 948004023)

23And the one was born from the slave girl according to flesh, but the {other}, from the free woman, through promise.


## Galatians 4:24 (id: 948004024)

24These things are being spoken as an allegory, for they are two covenants. One {is} from Mount Sinai, giving birth to slavery; this is Hagar.


## Galatians 4:25 (id: 948004025)

25Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children.


## Galatians 4:26 (id: 948004026)

26But the Jerusalem above is free, which is our mother.


## Galatians 4:27 (id: 948004027)

27For it is written, “Rejoice, you barren woman, the one not giving birth; break forth and shout, you {who are} not suffering the pains of childbirth; because the children of the desolate one {are} many more than of the one having a husband.”


## Galatians 4:28 (id: 948004028)

28Now you, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise.


## Galatians 4:29 (id: 948004029)

29But just as then, the one having been born according to flesh was persecuting the one according to Spirit, so {it} also {is} now.


## Galatians 4:30 (id: 948004030)

30But what does the scripture say? “Cast out the slave girl and her son. For the son of the slave girl will certainly not inherit with the son of the free woman.”


## Galatians 4:31 (id: 948004031)

31Therefore, brothers, we are not children of a slave girl, but of the free woman.


## Galatians 5:1 (id: 948005001)

1For freedom Christ set us free. Stand firm, therefore, and do not again be subjected to a yoke of slavery.


## Galatians 5:2 (id: 948005002)

2Behold, I, Paul, say to you that if you would be circumcised, Christ will benefit you nothing.


## Galatians 5:3 (id: 948005003)

3Now I testify again to every man being circumcised that he is obligated to do the whole law.


## Galatians 5:4 (id: 948005004)

4You were cut off from Christ, whoever is being justified by law; you fell from grace.


## Galatians 5:5 (id: 948005005)

5For through the Spirit, by faith, we eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness.


## Galatians 5:6 (id: 948005006)

6For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is capable of anything, but {only} faith working through love.


## Galatians 5:7 (id: 948005007)

7You were running well. Who hindered you, not to be persuaded by truth?


## Galatians 5:8 (id: 948005008)

8This persuasion {is} not from the one calling you!


## Galatians 5:9 (id: 948005009)

9A little leaven leavens the whole lump.


## Galatians 5:10 (id: 948005010)

10I am confident in you in the Lord that you will think nothing otherwise. But the one troubling you will bear the judgment, whoever he may be.


## Galatians 5:11 (id: 948005011)

11But brothers, if I still proclaim circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the stumbling block of the cross has been removed.


## Galatians 5:12 (id: 948005012)

12I wish the ones disturbing you will even castrate themselves!


## Galatians 5:13 (id: 948005013)

13For you have been called to freedom, brothers, only not the freedom for an opportunity for the flesh; rather, through love serve one another.


## Galatians 5:14 (id: 948005014)

14For all the law has been fulfilled in one command, in this, “You will love your neighbor as yourself.”


## Galatians 5:15 (id: 948005015)

15But if you are biting and devouring one another, watch out that you might not be consumed by one another.


## Galatians 5:16 (id: 948005016)

16Now I say, walk by the Spirit and you would certainly not fulfill desires of the flesh.


## Galatians 5:17 (id: 948005017)

17For the flesh desires against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh. For these oppose each other, so that you are not doing these things that you would desire.


## Galatians 5:18 (id: 948005018)

18But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.


## Galatians 5:19 (id: 948005019)

19Now the works of the flesh are evident, which are: sexual immorality, impurity, licentiousness,


## Galatians 5:20 (id: 948005020)

20idolatry, sorcery, hostilities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambition, divisions, factions,


## Galatians 5:21 (id: 948005021)

21envy, drunkenness, drunken celebrations, and things like these, about which I warn you, just as I warned you before, that the ones practicing such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.


## Galatians 5:22 (id: 948005022)

22But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,


## Galatians 5:23 (id: 948005023)

23gentleness, {and} self\-control; against such things there is no law.


## Galatians 5:24 (id: 948005024)

24But the ones of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with the passions and the desires.


## Galatians 5:25 (id: 948005025)

25If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.


## Galatians 5:26 (id: 948005026)

26Let us not become boastful, provoking one another, envying one another.


## Galatians 6:1 (id: 948006001)

1Brothers, even if a man is caught in any trespass, let you, the spiritual ones, restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness, considering yourself, lest you also be tempted.


## Galatians 6:2 (id: 948006002)

2Carry the burdens of one another, and thus you will fulfill the law of Christ.


## Galatians 6:3 (id: 948006003)

3For if anyone thinks {himself} to be something, being nothing, he deceives himself.


## Galatians 6:4 (id: 948006004)

4But let each one examine his own work, and then he will have reason to boast in himself alone and not in someone else.


## Galatians 6:5 (id: 948006005)

5For each one will carry his own burden.


## Galatians 6:6 (id: 948006006)

6But let the one being taught the word share in all good things with the one teaching.


## Galatians 6:7 (id: 948006007)

7Do not be deceived. God is not mocked, for whatever a man may sow, that he will also reap.


## Galatians 6:8 (id: 948006008)

8For the one sowing to his own flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction. But the one sowing to the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life.


## Galatians 6:9 (id: 948006009)

9But we should not become discouraged in doing good, for in due time, not becoming weary, we will reap.


## Galatians 6:10 (id: 948006010)

10So then, as we have time, we should do good to all, but especially to the ones of the household of the faith.


## Galatians 6:11 (id: 948006011)

11See what large letters I wrote to you with my own hand.


## Galatians 6:12 (id: 948006012)

12As many as desire to make a good impression in the flesh, they compel you to be circumcised, only so that they might not be persecuted for the cross of Christ Jesus.


## Galatians 6:13 (id: 948006013)

13For not even the ones circumcised keep the law themselves, but they want you to be circumcised so that they may boast in your flesh.


## Galatians 6:14 (id: 948006014)

14But may it never be to me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.


## Galatians 6:15 (id: 948006015)

15For neither circumcision is anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.


## Galatians 6:16 (id: 948006016)

16And as many as will walk in this standard, peace and mercy upon them and upon the Israel of God.


## Galatians 6:17 (id: 948006017)

17From now on let no one cause me trouble, for I carry in my body the marks of Jesus.


## Galatians 6:18 (id: 948006018)

18The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ {be} with your spirit, brothers. Amen.
