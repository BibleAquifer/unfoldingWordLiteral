## Luke 1:1 (id: 942001001)

1Since many have attempted to compile an account concerning the things that have been fulfilled among us,


## Luke 1:2 (id: 942001002)

2just as the ones having been from the beginning eyewitnesses and servants of the word handed them down to us,


## Luke 1:3 (id: 942001003)

3it seemed good to me also, having carefully investigated everything from the beginning, to write for you an orderly account, most excellent Theophilus,


## Luke 1:4 (id: 942001004)

4so that you might know the certainty concerning the things that you have been taught.


## Luke 1:5 (id: 942001005)

5In the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a certain priest named Zechariah, from the division of Abijah. And his wife {was} from the daughters of Aaron, and her name {was} Elizabeth.


## Luke 1:6 (id: 942001006)

6And they were both righteous in front of God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and statutes of the Lord.


## Luke 1:7 (id: 942001007)

7But they did not have a child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both advanced in their days.


## Luke 1:8 (id: 942001008)

8And it happened that in his performing as priest before God, in the order of his division,


## Luke 1:9 (id: 942001009)

9according to the custom of the priesthood, he came up by lot to enter into the temple of the Lord to burn incense.


## Luke 1:10 (id: 942001010)

10And the whole crowd of the people was praying outside at the hour of the incense offering.


## Luke 1:11 (id: 942001011)

11Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense.


## Luke 1:12 (id: 942001012)

12And Zechariah was troubled, having seen {him}, and fear fell on him.


## Luke 1:13 (id: 942001013)

13But the angel said to him, “Do not be afraid, Zechariah, because your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you will call his name John.


## Luke 1:14 (id: 942001014)

14And there will be joy and gladness to you, and many will rejoice at his birth.


## Luke 1:15 (id: 942001015)

15For he will be great before the Lord, and he must never drink wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even from his mother’s womb.


## Luke 1:16 (id: 942001016)

16And he will turn many of the sons of Israel back to the Lord their God.


## Luke 1:17 (id: 942001017)

17And he will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of fathers back to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous—to make ready for the Lord a people prepared.”


## Luke 1:18 (id: 942001018)

18Then Zechariah said to the angel, “How will I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in her days.”


## Luke 1:19 (id: 942001019)

19And answering, the angel said to him, “I am Gabriel, the one standing before God, and I was sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news.


## Luke 1:20 (id: 942001020)

20And behold, you will be silent and not able to speak until that day when these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time.”


## Luke 1:21 (id: 942001021)

21And the people were waiting for Zechariah, and they were wondering at his delaying in the temple.


## Luke 1:22 (id: 942001022)

22But having come out, he was not able to speak to them and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple; and he was making signs to them and remained unable to speak.


## Luke 1:23 (id: 942001023)

23And it happened that, when the days of his priestly service were fulfilled, he went away to his home.


## Luke 1:24 (id: 942001024)

24And after these days, his wife Elizabeth conceived, and for five months she hid herself, saying,


## Luke 1:25 (id: 942001025)

25“Thus the Lord has done for me, in the days in which he looked upon {me}, to take away my disgrace among men.”


## Luke 1:26 (id: 942001026)

26And in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city in Galilee whose name {was} Nazareth,


## Luke 1:27 (id: 942001027)

27to a virgin engaged to a man whose name {was} Joseph, of the house of David, and the name of the virgin {was} Mary.


## Luke 1:28 (id: 942001028)

28And coming to her, the angel said, “Rejoice, favored one! The Lord {is} with you.”


## Luke 1:29 (id: 942001029)

29But she was troubled by the words and she was considering what kind of greeting this might be.


## Luke 1:30 (id: 942001030)

30And the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.


## Luke 1:31 (id: 942001031)

31And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you will call his name Jesus.


## Luke 1:32 (id: 942001032)

32He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David.


## Luke 1:33 (id: 942001033)

33And he will reign over the house of Jacob to eternity, and there will be no end of his kingship.”


## Luke 1:34 (id: 942001034)

34But Mary said to the angel, “How will this be, since I have not known a man?”


## Luke 1:35 (id: 942001035)

35And answering, the angel said to her, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and power of the Most High will overshadow you. Therefore, the holy one being born will be called the Son of God.


## Luke 1:36 (id: 942001036)

36And behold, your relative Elizabeth—she also has conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month for her, the one called barren.


## Luke 1:37 (id: 942001037)

37For every word will not be impossible for God.”


## Luke 1:38 (id: 942001038)

38Then Mary said, “Behold, the female servant of the Lord. May it happen to me according to your word.” Then the angel went away from her.


## Luke 1:39 (id: 942001039)

39Then Mary arose in those days {and} went with haste into the hill country, to a city of Judah,


## Luke 1:40 (id: 942001040)

40and she entered into the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth.


## Luke 1:41 (id: 942001041)

41And it happened that, when Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the baby in her womb leaped, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.


## Luke 1:42 (id: 942001042)

42And she exclaimed in a loud voice and said, “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb.


## Luke 1:43 (id: 942001043)

43And from where {is} this to me, that the mother of my Lord would come to me?


## Luke 1:44 (id: 942001044)

44For behold, as soon as the sound of your greeting was in my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy.


## Luke 1:45 (id: 942001045)

45And blessed {is} the one having believed that there would be a fulfillment of the {things that} had been spoken to her from the Lord.”


## Luke 1:46 (id: 942001046)

46And Mary said, “My soul magnifies the Lord,


## Luke 1:47 (id: 942001047)

47and my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior.


## Luke 1:48 (id: 942001048)

48For he has looked upon the low condition of his female servant. For behold, from now on all generations will call me blessed,


## Luke 1:49 (id: 942001049)

49for the Mighty One has done great things for me, and his name {is} holy,


## Luke 1:50 (id: 942001050)

50and his mercy {is} unto generation and generation to the ones fearing him.


## Luke 1:51 (id: 942001051)

51He has done mighty deeds with his arm; he has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts.


## Luke 1:52 (id: 942001052)

52He has thrown down rulers from their thrones and he has raised up the lowly.


## Luke 1:53 (id: 942001053)

53He has filled the hungry with good things, but the rich he has sent away empty.


## Luke 1:54 (id: 942001054)

54He has helped Israel his servant, to remember his mercy,


## Luke 1:55 (id: 942001055)

55as he spoke to our fathers—to Abraham and to his seed in the ages {past}.”


## Luke 1:56 (id: 942001056)

56And Mary stayed with her about three months, and returned to her house.


## Luke 1:57 (id: 942001057)

57And the time was fulfilled for Elizabeth for her to deliver, and she gave birth to a son.


## Luke 1:58 (id: 942001058)

58And her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had magnified his mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her.


## Luke 1:59 (id: 942001059)

59And it happened that, on the eighth day, they came to circumcise the child, and they were going to call {him} after the name of his father, Zechariah.


## Luke 1:60 (id: 942001060)

60But answering, his mother said, “No. Rather, he will be called John.”


## Luke 1:61 (id: 942001061)

61But they said to her, “There is no one among your relatives who is called by this name.”


## Luke 1:62 (id: 942001062)

62Then they made signs to his father as to what he wanted to call him.


## Luke 1:63 (id: 942001063)

63And asking for a writing tablet, he wrote, saying, “His name is John.” And they all were astonished.


## Luke 1:64 (id: 942001064)

64Then immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue, and he spoke, blessing God.


## Luke 1:65 (id: 942001065)

65And fear came on all the ones living around them, and all these matters were being talked about throughout all the hill country of Judea.


## Luke 1:66 (id: 942001066)

66And all the ones having heard stored in their hearts, saying, “What then will this child become?” For indeed the hand of the Lord was with him.


## Luke 1:67 (id: 942001067)

67And his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied, saying,


## Luke 1:68 (id: 942001068)

68“Blessed {be} the Lord, the God of Israel, for he has visited and has accomplished redemption for his people.


## Luke 1:69 (id: 942001069)

69And he has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David


## Luke 1:70 (id: 942001070)

70(as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets from eternity),


## Luke 1:71 (id: 942001071)

71salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all the ones hating us;


## Luke 1:72 (id: 942001072)

72to show mercy to our fathers and to remember his holy covenant,


## Luke 1:73 (id: 942001073)

73the oath that he swore to Abraham our father, to grant us


## Luke 1:74 (id: 942001074)

74to serve him fearlessly, having been delivered out of the hand of our enemies,


## Luke 1:75 (id: 942001075)

75in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.


## Luke 1:76 (id: 942001076)

76And indeed, you, child, will be called a prophet of the Most High, for you will go before the Lord to prepare his paths;


## Luke 1:77 (id: 942001077)

77to give the knowledge of salvation to his people through forgiveness of their sins,


## Luke 1:78 (id: 942001078)

78because of the tender mercy of our God, by which the sunrise from on high will visit us,


## Luke 1:79 (id: 942001079)

79to shine on the ones sitting in darkness and a shadow of death; to guide our feet into a path of peace.”


## Luke 1:80 (id: 942001080)

80And the child was growing and was being strengthened in spirit, and he was in the wilderness until the day of his public appearance to Israel.


## Luke 2:1 (id: 942002001)

1And in those days, it happened that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus for all the world to register.


## Luke 2:2 (id: 942002002)

2This first registration happened {while} Quirinius was governing Syria.


## Luke 2:3 (id: 942002003)

3And everyone was traveling to register himself, each one to his own city.


## Luke 2:4 (id: 942002004)

4And Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family line of David.


## Luke 2:5 (id: 942002005)

5He registered himself with Mary, the one that had been engaged to him, being pregnant.


## Luke 2:6 (id: 942002006)

6And it happened that, while they were there, the days were fulfilled for her to deliver.


## Luke 2:7 (id: 942002007)

7And she delivered her firstborn son, and she wrapped him in strips of cloth and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.


## Luke 2:8 (id: 942002008)

8And there were shepherds in that area, staying in the open and keeping watch over their flock at night.


## Luke 2:9 (id: 942002009)

9And an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they feared a great fear.


## Luke 2:10 (id: 942002010)

10And the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy, which will be to all the people.


## Luke 2:11 (id: 942002011)

11For today has been born for you in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord!


## Luke 2:12 (id: 942002012)

12And this {will be} the sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth and lying in a manger.”


## Luke 2:13 (id: 942002013)

13And suddenly a multitude of the heavenly army was with the angel, praising God, and saying,


## Luke 2:14 (id: 942002014)

14“Glory in the highest to God, and on earth, peace among men of good pleasure.”


## Luke 2:15 (id: 942002015)

15And it happened that, when the angels had gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said to each other, “Let us indeed go over as far as Bethlehem, and let us see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.”


## Luke 2:16 (id: 942002016)

16And they went hastening and found both Mary and Joseph, and the baby, lying in the manger.


## Luke 2:17 (id: 942002017)

17And having seen him, they made known about the message that had been told to them about this child.


## Luke 2:18 (id: 942002018)

18And all the ones having heard {it} were amazed concerning the things that were spoken to them by the shepherds.


## Luke 2:19 (id: 942002019)

19But Mary kept all these things, pondering them in her heart.


## Luke 2:20 (id: 942002020)

20And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for everything that they had heard and seen, just as it had been spoken to them.


## Luke 2:21 (id: 942002021)

21And when eight days had been fulfilled to circumcise him, then his name was called Jesus, {which} he had been called by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.


## Luke 2:22 (id: 942002022)

22And when the days of their purification had been fulfilled, according to the law of Moses, they brought him up to Jerusalem to present {him} to the Lord


## Luke 2:23 (id: 942002023)

23(just as it is written in the law of the Lord, “Every male who opens the womb will be called holy to the Lord”),


## Luke 2:24 (id: 942002024)

24and to offer a sacrifice according to {what} had been said in the law of the Lord, “a pair of doves or two young pigeons.”


## Luke 2:25 (id: 942002025)

25And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name {was} Simeon, and this man {was} righteous and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.


## Luke 2:26 (id: 942002026)

26And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord’s Christ.


## Luke 2:27 (id: 942002027)

27And he came in the Spirit into the temple; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus for them to do according to the custom of the law concerning him,


## Luke 2:28 (id: 942002028)

28and he took him into his arms and blessed God, and he said,


## Luke 2:29 (id: 942002029)

29“You are now dismissing your servant in peace, Lord, according to your word.


## Luke 2:30 (id: 942002030)

30For my eyes have seen your salvation,


## Luke 2:31 (id: 942002031)

31which you have prepared before the face of all the peoples:


## Luke 2:32 (id: 942002032)

32A light for revelation to the Gentiles and glory to your people Israel.”


## Luke 2:33 (id: 942002033)

33And his father and mother were amazed at what is being said about him.


## Luke 2:34 (id: 942002034)

34And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary, his mother, “Behold, this one is appointed for the downfall and rising up of many in Israel and for a sign that is spoken against—


## Luke 2:35 (id: 942002035)

35and a sword will also pierce your own soul—so that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.”


## Luke 2:36 (id: 942002036)

36And Anna was there, a prophetess, a daughter of Phanuel from the tribe of Asher. She had advanced much in days, having lived with her husband for seven years after her virginity,


## Luke 2:37 (id: 942002037)

37and she {was} a widow for 84 years who never left the temple, serving with fastings and prayers night and day.


## Luke 2:38 (id: 942002038)

38And coming up at that very hour, she began giving thanks to God and speaking about him to all the ones waiting for the redemption of Jerusalem.


## Luke 2:39 (id: 942002039)

39And when they had completed everything {that was} according to the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own town of Nazareth.


## Luke 2:40 (id: 942002040)

40And the child grew and was strengthened, being filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him.


## Luke 2:41 (id: 942002041)

41And his parents went every year to Jerusalem to the Feast of the Passover.


## Luke 2:42 (id: 942002042)

42And when he was 12 years old, they went up according to the custom of the feast.


## Luke 2:43 (id: 942002043)

43And the days having been completed, as they were returning, the boy Jesus remained in Jerusalem, but his parents did not know {it}.


## Luke 2:44 (id: 942002044)

44But thinking that he was with the group of travelers, they went a day’s journey and they sought him among their relatives and friends.


## Luke 2:45 (id: 942002045)

45And not finding {him}, they returned to Jerusalem, searching for him.


## Luke 2:46 (id: 942002046)

46And it happened that, after three days, they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers and listening to them and asking them questions.


## Luke 2:47 (id: 942002047)

47And all the ones hearing him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.


## Luke 2:48 (id: 942002048)

48And having seen him, they were astonished, and his mother said to him, “Child, why have you treated us thus? Behold, your father and I have been tormented searching for you.”


## Luke 2:49 (id: 942002049)

49And he said to them, “Why {is it} that you were searching for me? Did you not know that I must be in the things of my Father?”


## Luke 2:50 (id: 942002050)

50But they did not understand the word that he spoke to them.


## Luke 2:51 (id: 942002051)

51Then he went down with them and came to Nazareth and was subjected to them. But his mother kept all these things in her heart.


## Luke 2:52 (id: 942002052)

52And Jesus was increasing in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.


## Luke 3:1 (id: 942003001)

1And in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar—Pontius Pilate governing Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip being tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias being tetrarch of Abilene,


## Luke 3:2 (id: 942003002)

2during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas—the word of God came to John, the son of Zechariah, in the wilderness.


## Luke 3:3 (id: 942003003)

3And he went into all the region around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins.


## Luke 3:4 (id: 942003004)

4As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, “A voice of one calling out in the wilderness, ‘Make ready the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.


## Luke 3:5 (id: 942003005)

5Every valley will be filled, and every mountain and hill will be made low, and the crooked roads will become straight, and the rough roads {will become} smooth,


## Luke 3:6 (id: 942003006)

6and all flesh will see the salvation of God.’”


## Luke 3:7 (id: 942003007)

7So he said to the crowds coming out to be baptized by him, “Offspring of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?


## Luke 3:8 (id: 942003008)

8Therefore, produce fruits worthy of repentance, and do not begin to say within yourselves, ‘We have Abraham {as} father.’ For I say to you that God is able to raise up children for Abraham from these stones.


## Luke 3:9 (id: 942003009)

9But indeed, the ax is already set against the root of the trees. So, every tree not producing good fruit is chopped down and thrown into a fire.”


## Luke 3:10 (id: 942003010)

10And the crowds kept asking him, saying, “What therefore should we do?”


## Luke 3:11 (id: 942003011)

11So answering, he said to them, “The one having two tunics must share with the one not having, and the one having food, let him do the same.”


## Luke 3:12 (id: 942003012)

12Then tax collectors also came to be baptized, and they said to him, “Teacher, what should we do?”


## Luke 3:13 (id: 942003013)

13So he said to them, “Collect nothing more than {what} you have been ordered.”


## Luke 3:14 (id: 942003014)

14Then soldiers also asked him, saying, “And us, what should we do?” And he said to them, “Take nothing by force, and do not accuse falsely, and be contented with your wages.”


## Luke 3:15 (id: 942003015)

15And the people were expecting and were all wondering in their hearts concerning John, whether he might be the Christ.


## Luke 3:16 (id: 942003016)

16John answered, saying to them all, “I indeed baptize you with water, but one more powerful than I is coming, of whom I am not worthy to untie the strap of his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire,


## Luke 3:17 (id: 942003017)

17whose winnowing fork {is} in his hand to thoroughly clear off his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his storehouse, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”


## Luke 3:18 (id: 942003018)

18Therefore, also exhorting many other things, he preached good news to the people.


## Luke 3:19 (id: 942003019)

19But Herod the tetrarch, having been rebuked by him concerning Herodias, the wife of his brother, and concerning all the evil things that Herod had done,


## Luke 3:20 (id: 942003020)

20added even this to {them} all: He locked John up in prison.


## Luke 3:21 (id: 942003021)

21And it happened that when all the people were being baptized, Jesus also was baptized and, {as} he was praying, heaven was opened,


## Luke 3:22 (id: 942003022)

22and the Holy Spirit in bodily form came down on him like a dove, and a voice came from heaven, “You are my beloved Son. With you I am well pleased.”


## Luke 3:23 (id: 942003023)

23And Jesus himself was beginning about 30 years old, being the son (as it was assumed) of Joseph, of Heli,

## Luke 4:1 (id: 942004001)

1Then Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,


## Luke 4:2 (id: 942004002)

2for 40 days being tempted by the devil. And he did not eat anything during those days, and he was hungry {when} they were completed.


## Luke 4:3 (id: 942004003)

3Then the devil said to him, “If you are the Son of God, speak to this stone so that it might become bread.”


## Luke 4:4 (id: 942004004)

4And Jesus answered to him, “It is written, ‘Man will not live on bread alone.’”


## Luke 4:5 (id: 942004005)

5Then he led him up {and} showed him all the kingdoms of the world in an instant of time.


## Luke 4:6 (id: 942004006)

6And the devil said to him, “I will give to you all this authority and their glory, for it has been handed over to me, and I can give it to anyone I want.


## Luke 4:7 (id: 942004007)

7So then, if you will bow in worship before me, it will all be yours.”


## Luke 4:8 (id: 942004008)

8But answering, Jesus said to him, “It is written, ‘You will worship the Lord your God, and you will serve only him.’”


## Luke 4:9 (id: 942004009)

9Then he led him to Jerusalem and set {him} on the highest point of the temple, and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here.


## Luke 4:10 (id: 942004010)

10For it is written, ‘He will command his angels concerning you, to protect you,’


## Luke 4:11 (id: 942004011)

11and, ‘They will lift you up in their hands, lest you strike your foot against a stone.’”


## Luke 4:12 (id: 942004012)

12But answering, Jesus said to him, “It is said, ‘You will not test the Lord your God.’”


## Luke 4:13 (id: 942004013)

13And having finished every temptation, the devil went away from him until an opportune time.


## Luke 4:14 (id: 942004014)

14And Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about him went out throughout the entire surrounding region.


## Luke 4:15 (id: 942004015)

15And he began to teach in their synagogues, being glorified by all.


## Luke 4:16 (id: 942004016)

16And he came to Nazareth, where he had been raised, and according to his custom, he entered into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and he stood up to read aloud.


## Luke 4:17 (id: 942004017)

17And the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him and, opening the scroll, he found the place where it was written,


## Luke 4:18 (id: 942004018)

18“The Spirit of the Lord {is} upon me, because he has anointed me to proclaim the gospel to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind, to set free the oppressed,


## Luke 4:19 (id: 942004019)

19to proclaim the favorable year of the Lord.”


## Luke 4:20 (id: 942004020)

20And having rolled up the scroll {and} having given it back to the attendant, he sat down. And all the eyes in the synagogue were gazing on him.


## Luke 4:21 (id: 942004021)

21Then he began to say to them, “Today this scripture has been fulfilled in your ears.”


## Luke 4:22 (id: 942004022)

22And everyone spoke well of him and they were amazed at the gracious words that were coming out of his mouth, and they said, “Is this not the son of Joseph?”


## Luke 4:23 (id: 942004023)

23And he said to them, “Surely you will say this proverb to me, ‘Doctor, heal yourself. Whatever we heard happened in Capernaum, also do here in your hometown.’”


## Luke 4:24 (id: 942004024)

24But he said, “Truly I say to you that no prophet is accepted in his hometown.


## Luke 4:25 (id: 942004025)

25But in truth I say to you that there were many widows in Israel during the days of Elijah, when the sky was shut up for three years and six months, when a great famine came upon all the land.


## Luke 4:26 (id: 942004026)

26But Elijah was sent to none of them except to Zarephath in Sidon, to a widow woman.


## Luke 4:27 (id: 942004027)

27And there were many lepers in Israel during {the time of} Elisha the prophet, but none of them were cleansed except Naaman the Syrian.”


## Luke 4:28 (id: 942004028)

28And all in the synagogue were filled with rage, having heard these things.


## Luke 4:29 (id: 942004029)

29And rising up, they drove him out of the town, and they led him to the edge of the hill on which their town was built, so as to throw him off.


## Luke 4:30 (id: 942004030)

30But he, passing through the midst of them, went on his way.


## Luke 4:31 (id: 942004031)

31And he went down to Capernaum, a city in Galilee, and he was teaching them on the Sabbaths.


## Luke 4:32 (id: 942004032)

32And they were astonished at his teaching, because his word was with authority.


## Luke 4:33 (id: 942004033)

33And in the synagogue there was a man having a spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice,


## Luke 4:34 (id: 942004034)

34“Ha! What to us and to you, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!”


## Luke 4:35 (id: 942004035)

35And Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be silenced, and come out of him!” And having thrown him down in their midst, the demon came out of him, not hurting him.


## Luke 4:36 (id: 942004036)

36And astonishment came upon everyone, and they were talking to one another, saying, “What {is} this word, that he commands the unclean spirits with authority and power, and they come out?”


## Luke 4:37 (id: 942004037)

37And a report about him went out into every place of the surrounding region.


## Luke 4:38 (id: 942004038)

38Then arising from the synagogue, he entered into the house of Simon. And Simon’s mother\-in\-law was suffering with a high fever, and they asked him concerning her.


## Luke 4:39 (id: 942004039)

39And standing over her, he rebuked the fever, and it left her, and immediately having gotten up, she began to serve them.


## Luke 4:40 (id: 942004040)

40And {as} the sun was setting, everyone having ones being sick with various diseases brought them to him and, laying his hands on each of them, he was healing them.


## Luke 4:41 (id: 942004041)

41And demons also were coming out from many, crying out, and saying, “You are the Son of God!” But he was rebuking them, not permitting them to speak, because they knew he was the Christ.


## Luke 4:42 (id: 942004042)

42And day having come, having gone out, he went to a desolate place, but the crowds were looking for him and came to him, and they restrained him not to go away from them.


## Luke 4:43 (id: 942004043)

43But he said to them, “It is necessary for me to proclaim the gospel about the kingdom of God also to other cities, because for this I was sent.”


## Luke 4:44 (id: 942004044)

44And he was preaching in the synagogues in Judea.


## Luke 5:1 (id: 942005001)

1And it happened that the crowd was pressing in on him and listening to the word of God, and he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret.


## Luke 5:2 (id: 942005002)

2And he saw two boats standing by the lake, but the fishermen had gotten out of them {and} were washing their nets.


## Luke 5:3 (id: 942005003)

3Then he got into one of the boats, which was Simon’s, {and} asked him to put out a little from the land. Then he sat down {and} was teaching the crowds from the boat.


## Luke 5:4 (id: 942005004)

4Then when he stopped speaking, he said to Simon, “Put out into the deep water and let down your nets for a catch.”


## Luke 5:5 (id: 942005005)

5But answering, Simon said, “Master, we worked through the entire night {and} caught nothing, but at your word, I will let down the nets.”


## Luke 5:6 (id: 942005006)

6And having done this, they caught a very large number of fish, and their nets began to break.


## Luke 5:7 (id: 942005007)

7And they signaled to their partners in the other boat that they should come to help them, and they came and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink.


## Luke 5:8 (id: 942005008)

8But Simon Peter, having seen {it}, he fell down at the knees of Jesus, saying, “Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord.”


## Luke 5:9 (id: 942005009)

9For amazement had seized him and all the ones with him at the catch of fish that they had taken,


## Luke 5:10 (id: 942005010)

10and likewise also James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, “Do not be afraid; from now on you will be catching men.”


## Luke 5:11 (id: 942005011)

11And having brought the boats to the land, they left everything {and} followed him.


## Luke 5:12 (id: 942005012)

12And it happened that he was in one of the cities, and behold, a man full of leprosy. And seeing Jesus, he fell on his face {and} begged him, saying, “Lord, if you are willing, you are able to make me clean.”


## Luke 5:13 (id: 942005013)

13And having reached out his hand, he touched him, saying, “I am willing. Be clean.” And immediately the leprosy departed from him.


## Luke 5:14 (id: 942005014)

14And he commanded him to tell no one, but, “Go, show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing as Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.”


## Luke 5:15 (id: 942005015)

15But the word about him spread even more, and large crowds came together to hear him and to be healed from their sicknesses.


## Luke 5:16 (id: 942005016)

16But he was withdrawing into the deserted places and praying.


## Luke 5:17 (id: 942005017)

17And it happened on one of those days that he was teaching, and there were Pharisees and law teachers sitting there who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem, and power of the Lord was upon him to heal.


## Luke 5:18 (id: 942005018)

18And behold, men carrying on a mat a man who was paralyzed, and they were seeking to bring him inside and to set him before him.


## Luke 5:19 (id: 942005019)

19And not finding a way to bring him in because of the crowd, having gone up to the housetop, they let him down through the tiles on his mat into the midst before Jesus.


## Luke 5:20 (id: 942005020)

20And having seen their faith, he said, “Man, your sins are forgiven you.”


## Luke 5:21 (id: 942005021)

21And the scribes and the Pharisees began to debate, saying, “Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who is able to forgive sins except God alone?”


## Luke 5:22 (id: 942005022)

22But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, answering said to them, “Why are you debating in your hearts?


## Luke 5:23 (id: 942005023)

23Which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven you,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk?’


## Luke 5:24 (id: 942005024)

24But in order that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on the earth to forgive sins,”—he said to the one that had been paralyzed—“I say to you, get up, and picking up your mat, go to your house.”


## Luke 5:25 (id: 942005025)

25And immediately he got up before them, picked up that on which he had been lying, and went away to his house glorifying God.


## Luke 5:26 (id: 942005026)

26And amazement seized them all, and they glorified God, and they were filled with fear, saying, “We have seen astonishing things today.”


## Luke 5:27 (id: 942005027)

27And after these things, he went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax collector’s office, and he said to him, “Follow me.”


## Luke 5:28 (id: 942005028)

28And having left everything behind, having gotten up, he began to follow him.


## Luke 5:29 (id: 942005029)

29And Levi made a great banquet in his house for him, and there was a large crowd of tax collectors and others, who were reclining to eat with them.


## Luke 5:30 (id: 942005030)

30But the Pharisees and their scribes were murmuring to his disciples, saying, “Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?”


## Luke 5:31 (id: 942005031)

31And answering, Jesus said to them, “The ones being well do not have need of a physician, but the ones having sickness.


## Luke 5:32 (id: 942005032)

32I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”


## Luke 5:33 (id: 942005033)

33Then they said to him, “The disciples of John often fast and make prayers, and likewise the ones of the Pharisees. But the ones of yours eat and drink.”


## Luke 5:34 (id: 942005034)

34Then he said to them, “You are not able to make the sons of the bridal chamber fast while the bridegroom is still with them, are you?


## Luke 5:35 (id: 942005035)

35But days will indeed come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them. Then, in those days, they will fast.”


## Luke 5:36 (id: 942005036)

36Then he also spoke a parable to them. “No one, having torn a piece of cloth from a new garment, puts it onto an old garment. But if not, the new will tear, and the old will not match the piece that is from the new.


## Luke 5:37 (id: 942005037)

37And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. But if not, the new wine will burst the wineskins, and it will be spilled out, and the wineskins will be destroyed.


## Luke 5:38 (id: 942005038)

38But one must put new wine into new wineskins.


## Luke 5:39 (id: 942005039)

39No one, having drunk the old, wants the new, for he says, ‘The old is better.’”


## Luke 6:1 (id: 942006001)

1And it happened that, on a Sabbath he was going through grainfields, and his disciples were picking and eating the heads of grain, rubbing them in their hands.


## Luke 6:2 (id: 942006002)

2But some of the Pharisees said, “Why are you doing what is not lawful on the Sabbaths?”


## Luke 6:3 (id: 942006003)

3And answering them, Jesus said, “Have you not read this, what David did when he was hungry, he and the ones being with him:


## Luke 6:4 (id: 942006004)

4how he went into the house of God and took the loaves of the presence, ate it, and gave it to the ones with him, which is not lawful to eat except only for the priests?”


## Luke 6:5 (id: 942006005)

5And he said to them, “The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.”


## Luke 6:6 (id: 942006006)

6And it happened that, on another Sabbath, he entered into the synagogue and taught, and there was a man there, and his right hand was withered.


## Luke 6:7 (id: 942006007)

7But the scribes and the Pharisees were watching him closely, if he will heal on the Sabbath, so that they might find to accuse him.


## Luke 6:8 (id: 942006008)

8But he knew their thinking and he said to the man having the withered hand, “Get up, and stand in the midst.” So he got up {and} stood.


## Luke 6:9 (id: 942006009)

9Then Jesus said to them, “I ask you if {it is} lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save a life or to destroy?”


## Luke 6:10 (id: 942006010)

10And having looked around at them all, he said to him, “Stretch out your hand.” And he did, and his hand was restored.


## Luke 6:11 (id: 942006011)

11But they were filled with rage and they were talking to each other about what they might do to Jesus.


## Luke 6:12 (id: 942006012)

12And it happened that, in those days, he went out to the mountain to pray, and he was spending the whole night in prayer to God.


## Luke 6:13 (id: 942006013)

13And when day came, he called his disciples, and he chose 12 from them, whom he also named apostles:


## Luke 6:14 (id: 942006014)

14Simon (whom he also named Peter) and his brother Andrew; and James and John; and Philip and Bartholomew;


## Luke 6:15 (id: 942006015)

15and Matthew and Thomas; and James son of Alphaeus; and Simon, the one called the Zealot;


## Luke 6:16 (id: 942006016)

16and Judas son of James; and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.


## Luke 6:17 (id: 942006017)

17And having come down with them, he stood on a level place with a large crowd of his disciples and a great multitude of the people from all Judea and Jerusalem and the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon.


## Luke 6:18 (id: 942006018)

18They had come to listen to him and to be healed from their diseases. And the ones being troubled by unclean spirits were being healed.


## Luke 6:19 (id: 942006019)

19And the whole crowd was seeking to touch him because power was coming out from him and healing everyone.


## Luke 6:20 (id: 942006020)

20And he, having lifted up his eyes upon his disciples, said, “Blessed {are} the poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.


## Luke 6:21 (id: 942006021)

21Blessed {are} the ones being hungry now, for you will be fed. Blessed {are} the ones weeping now, for you will laugh.


## Luke 6:22 (id: 942006022)

22Blessed are you when men hate you, and when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil because of the Son of Man.


## Luke 6:23 (id: 942006023)

23Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, for behold, your reward {is} great in heaven. For their fathers did according to the same things to the prophets.


## Luke 6:24 (id: 942006024)

24But woe to you, the rich, for you have received your comfort.


## Luke 6:25 (id: 942006025)

25Woe to you, the ones being filled now, for you will be hungry. Woe to the ones laughing now, for you will mourn and weep.


## Luke 6:26 (id: 942006026)

26Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for their fathers did according to the same things to the false prophets.


## Luke 6:27 (id: 942006027)

27But I say to you, the ones listening, love your enemies {and} do good to the ones hating you.


## Luke 6:28 (id: 942006028)

28Bless the ones cursing you {and} pray for the ones mistreating you.


## Luke 6:29 (id: 942006029)

29To the one striking you on the cheek, offer also the other, and from the one taking away your cloak, also do not withhold your tunic.


## Luke 6:30 (id: 942006030)

30Give to everyone asking you, and from the one taking away what {is} yours, do not ask for it back.


## Luke 6:31 (id: 942006031)

31And as you desire that men would do to you, do the same to them.


## Luke 6:32 (id: 942006032)

32And if you love the ones loving you, what credit is that to you? For even the sinners love the ones loving them.


## Luke 6:33 (id: 942006033)

33For if indeed you do good to the ones doing good to you, what credit is that to you? Even the sinners do the same.


## Luke 6:34 (id: 942006034)

34And if you lend to {the ones} from whom you expect to receive back, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, so that they may receive back the same things.


## Luke 6:35 (id: 942006035)

35But love your enemies and do good to {them}, and lend, expecting nothing in return, and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High, for he is kind toward the ungrateful and evil.


## Luke 6:36 (id: 942006036)

36Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.


## Luke 6:37 (id: 942006037)

37And do not judge, and you will certainly not be judged. And do not condemn, and you will certainly not be condemned. Release, and you will be released.


## Luke 6:38 (id: 942006038)

38Give, and it will be given to you: a good measure—pressed down, shaken together, spilling over—they will pour into your lap. For with the measure by which you measure, it will be measured back to you.”


## Luke 6:39 (id: 942006039)

39Then he also told them a parable. “A blind one is not able to guide a blind one, is he? Would not both fall into a pit?


## Luke 6:40 (id: 942006040)

40A disciple is not above his teacher, but everyone having been fully trained will be like his teacher.


## Luke 6:41 (id: 942006041)

41And why do you look at the speck of wood that {is} in the eye of your brother, but you do not notice the log that {is} in your own eye?


## Luke 6:42 (id: 942006042)

42How can you say to your brother, ‘Brother, let me take out the speck of wood that {is} in your eye,’ you yourself not seeing the log in your eye? You hypocrite! First take out the log from your eye, and then you will see clearly to take out the speck of wood {that is} in the eye of your brother.


## Luke 6:43 (id: 942006043)

43For there is no good tree that produces rotten fruit, nor, on the other hand, any rotten tree that produces good fruit.


## Luke 6:44 (id: 942006044)

44For each tree is known by {its} own fruit. For they do not gather figs from a thornbush, nor do they gather grapes from a briar bush.


## Luke 6:45 (id: 942006045)

45The good man from the good treasure of his heart produces {what is} good, and the evil man from evil produces {what is} evil. For out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.


## Luke 6:46 (id: 942006046)

46And why do you call me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ but not do what I say?


## Luke 6:47 (id: 942006047)

47Everyone coming to me and hearing my words, and doing them, I will show you what he is like.


## Luke 6:48 (id: 942006048)

48He is like a man building a house, who dug down and dug deep and laid a foundation on the rock. Then a flood having come, the torrent of water flowed against that house, but it could not shake it, because it had been built well.


## Luke 6:49 (id: 942006049)

49But the one having heard and not having done, he is like a man having built a house on the ground without a foundation, against which the torrent of water flowed, and immediately it collapsed, and the ruin of that house was great.”


## Luke 7:1 (id: 942007001)

1When he had finished all his words in the hearing of the people, he entered into Capernaum.


## Luke 7:2 (id: 942007002)

2And a certain servant of a centurion, who was highly regarded by him, being sick, was about to die.


## Luke 7:3 (id: 942007003)

3And having heard about Jesus, he sent elders of the Jews to him, asking him to come so that he might save his servant.


## Luke 7:4 (id: 942007004)

4And the ones having come to Jesus asked him earnestly, saying, “He is worthy that you will grant this to him,


## Luke 7:5 (id: 942007005)

5because he loves our nation, and he built the synagogue for us.”


## Luke 7:6 (id: 942007006)

6And Jesus went with them. But he already not being far away from the house, the centurion sent friends, saying to him, “Lord, do not trouble yourself, because I am not worthy that you might enter under my roof.


## Luke 7:7 (id: 942007007)

7Therefore I did not even consider myself worthy to come to you. But speak with a word and let my servant be healed.


## Luke 7:8 (id: 942007008)

8For I also am a man placed under authority, having soldiers under me, and I say to this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and to another one, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does {it}.”


## Luke 7:9 (id: 942007009)

9And Jesus, having heard this, marveled at him, and turning to the crowd following him, he said, “I say to you, not even in Israel have I found such faith.”


## Luke 7:10 (id: 942007010)

10And having returned to the house, the ones having been sent found the servant was well.


## Luke 7:11 (id: 942007011)

11And it happened on the next day that he went into a city called Nain, and his disciples and a great crowd were going with him.


## Luke 7:12 (id: 942007012)

12And as he approached the gate of the city, and behold, one that had died was being carried out, the one and only son of his mother (and she was a widow), and a rather large crowd from the city was with her.


## Luke 7:13 (id: 942007013)

13And having seen her, the Lord felt compassion for her, and said to her, “Do not weep.”


## Luke 7:14 (id: 942007014)

14And having approached, he touched the bier, and the ones carrying it stood still. Then he said, “Young man, I say to you, arise.”


## Luke 7:15 (id: 942007015)

15And the dead man sat up and began to speak, and he gave him to his mother.


## Luke 7:16 (id: 942007016)

16Then fear seized all {of them}, and they were glorifying God, saying, “A great prophet has been raised among us” and “God has visited his people.”


## Luke 7:17 (id: 942007017)

17And this word about him went out throughout the whole of Judea and all the surrounding region.


## Luke 7:18 (id: 942007018)

18And his disciples reported to John concerning all these things. And calling two of his disciples, John


## Luke 7:19 (id: 942007019)

19sent to the Lord to say, “Are you the one coming, or should we expect another?”


## Luke 7:20 (id: 942007020)

20And having come to him, the men said, “John the Baptist has sent us to you to say, ‘Are you the one coming, or should we expect another?’”


## Luke 7:21 (id: 942007021)

21In that hour he healed many from sicknesses and afflictions and evil spirits, and to many blind {people} he granted to see.


## Luke 7:22 (id: 942007022)

22And answering, he said to them, “Having gone, report to John what you have seen and heard: the blind see again, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, the dead are raised, the poor are being told the gospel.


## Luke 7:23 (id: 942007023)

23And blessed is whoever is not caused to stumble on me.”


## Luke 7:24 (id: 942007024)

24Then after the messengers of John had gone away, he began to say to the crowds concerning John, “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?


## Luke 7:25 (id: 942007025)

25But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothes? Behold, the ones in expensive clothing and living in luxury are in kings’ palaces.


## Luke 7:26 (id: 942007026)

26But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and more than a prophet.


## Luke 7:27 (id: 942007027)

27This is he concerning whom it is written, ‘Behold, I am sending my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.’


## Luke 7:28 (id: 942007028)

28I say to you, among those born of women, no one is greater than John, but the least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.”


## Luke 7:29 (id: 942007029)

29(And all the people having heard, including the tax collectors, declared God to be righteous, having been baptized with the baptism of John.


## Luke 7:30 (id: 942007030)

30But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the purpose of God for themselves, not having been baptized by him.)


## Luke 7:31 (id: 942007031)

31“To what, then, will I compare the men of this generation? And what are they like?


## Luke 7:32 (id: 942007032)

32They are like children sitting in a marketplace and calling to one another, who say, ‘We played a flute for you, and you did not dance. We sang a funeral song, and you did not wail.’


## Luke 7:33 (id: 942007033)

33For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, ‘He has a demon.’


## Luke 7:34 (id: 942007034)

34The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Behold, a man, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’


## Luke 7:35 (id: 942007035)

35But wisdom has been justified by all her children.”


## Luke 7:36 (id: 942007036)

36Then one of the Pharisees requested him to eat with him. So entering into the house of the Pharisee, he reclined to eat.


## Luke 7:37 (id: 942007037)

37And behold, a woman who was in the city {was} a sinner. And having found out that he was reclining to eat in the house of the Pharisee, she brought an alabaster jar of perfumed oil


## Luke 7:38 (id: 942007038)

38and stood behind him near his feet, weeping. She began to wet his feet with her tears, and she was wiping them with the hair of her head and kissing his feet and anointing {them} with the perfumed oil.


## Luke 7:39 (id: 942007039)

39And the Pharisee who had invited him, having seen this, he said to himself, saying, “If this {man} were a prophet, he would know who and of what type {is} the woman who is touching him, that she is a sinner.”


## Luke 7:40 (id: 942007040)

40And answering, Jesus said to him, “Simon, I have something to say to you.” And he says, “Say it, Teacher!”


## Luke 7:41 (id: 942007041)

41“There were two debtors to a certain moneylender. The one owed 500 denarii, and the other 50\.


## Luke 7:42 (id: 942007042)

42{When} they did not have enough to repay, he forgave {them} both. Therefore, which of them will love him more?”


## Luke 7:43 (id: 942007043)

43Simon answering said, “I suppose that the one to whom he forgave the most.” Then he said to him, “You have judged correctly.”


## Luke 7:44 (id: 942007044)

44And turning to the woman, he said to Simon, “Do you see this woman? I entered into your house. You did not give me water for my feet, but she has wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.


## Luke 7:45 (id: 942007045)

45You did not give me a kiss, but from when I came in, she has not stopped kissing my feet.


## Luke 7:46 (id: 942007046)

46You did not anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with perfumed oil.


## Luke 7:47 (id: 942007047)

47Therefore I say to you, her sins, the many, have been forgiven—for she loved much. But the one to whom little is forgiven loves little.”


## Luke 7:48 (id: 942007048)

48Then he said to her, “Your sins are forgiven.”


## Luke 7:49 (id: 942007049)

49And those reclining with {him} to eat began to say among themselves, “Who is this who even forgives sins?”


## Luke 7:50 (id: 942007050)

50Then he said to the woman, “Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.”


## Luke 8:1 (id: 942008001)

1And it happened that soon afterward, he also began traveling through city and village, preaching and proclaiming the gospel {about} the kingdom of God, and the Twelve {were} with him,


## Luke 8:2 (id: 942008002)

2and certain women who had been healed from evil spirits and diseases: Mary called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out;


## Luke 8:3 (id: 942008003)

3and Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod’s manager; and Susanna; and many others; who were ministering to them out of their possessions.


## Luke 8:4 (id: 942008004)

4And {when} a large crowd was gathering, and coming to him from each city, he spoke in a parable:


## Luke 8:5 (id: 942008005)

5“The sower went out to sow his seed, and as he sowed, some fell beside the road, and it was trampled underfoot, and the birds of the sky devoured it.


## Luke 8:6 (id: 942008006)

6And other seed fell on the rock, and having grown up, it withered, because it had no moisture.


## Luke 8:7 (id: 942008007)

7And other seed fell in the midst of the thorns, and having grown up with {it}, the thorns choked it.


## Luke 8:8 (id: 942008008)

8And other seed fell on the good soil, and having grown up, it produced fruit a hundred times greater.” Saying these things, he called out, “The one having ears to hear, let him hear.”


## Luke 8:9 (id: 942008009)

9Then his disciples questioned him, “What is this parable?”


## Luke 8:10 (id: 942008010)

10And he said, “To you has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the rest in parables, so that, ‘Seeing, they may not see; and hearing, they may not understand.’


## Luke 8:11 (id: 942008011)

11And the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.


## Luke 8:12 (id: 942008012)

12And the ones along the path are the ones having heard, but then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so they may not believe {and} be saved.


## Luke 8:13 (id: 942008013)

13And the ones on the rock {are} the ones, when they hear, receive the word with joy. But they have no root; they believe for a time, and in a time of testing they go away.


## Luke 8:14 (id: 942008014)

14And the ones having fallen among the thorns, these are the ones having heard, but as they go on their way, they are choked by worries and riches and pleasures of this life, and they do not produce mature fruit.


## Luke 8:15 (id: 942008015)

15But the ones on the good soil, these are the ones who, having heard the word with an honest and good heart, hold it securely and bear fruit with endurance.


## Luke 8:16 (id: 942008016)

16And no one, having lit a lamp, covers it with a bowl or puts {it} under a bed. Rather, he puts {it} on a lampstand so that those who enter may see the light.


## Luke 8:17 (id: 942008017)

17For nothing is hidden that will not become visible, nor secret that will certainly not be known and come into visibility.


## Luke 8:18 (id: 942008018)

18So be careful how you listen, for whoever has, it will be given to him, but whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken away from him.”


## Luke 8:19 (id: 942008019)

19Then his mother and brothers came to him, but they were not able to get near him because of the crowd.


## Luke 8:20 (id: 942008020)

20Then it was reported to him, “Your mother and your brothers have stood outside, wanting to see you.”


## Luke 8:21 (id: 942008021)

21But answering, he said to them, “My mother and my brothers are those hearing and doing the word of God.”


## Luke 8:22 (id: 942008022)

22And it happened that, on one of those days, both he and his disciples got into a boat, and he said to them, “Let us go over to the other side of the lake.” So they put out.


## Luke 8:23 (id: 942008023)

23But as they voyaged, he fell asleep. Then a windstorm came down on the lake, and they were being filled and were in danger.


## Luke 8:24 (id: 942008024)

24Then they approached {and} woke him up, saying, “Master! Master! We are perishing!” But awaking, he rebuked the wind and the waves of the water, and they ceased, and there was a calm.


## Luke 8:25 (id: 942008025)

25Then he said to them, “Where {is} your faith?” Then having become afraid, they marveled, saying to one another, “Who then is this, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?”


## Luke 8:26 (id: 942008026)

26And they sailed to the region of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee.


## Luke 8:27 (id: 942008027)

27And {when} he came out onto the land, a certain man from the city, having demons, met him. And for a long time he had not worn clothes, and he did not live in a house, but in the tombs.


## Luke 8:28 (id: 942008028)

28And having seen Jesus, he cried out, fell down before him, and said in a loud voice, “What to me and to you, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, do not torment me.”


## Luke 8:29 (id: 942008029)

29For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out from the man. For many times it had seized him, and he was bound with chains and shackles {and} kept under guard, and breaking his bonds, he would be driven by the demon into the wilderness.


## Luke 8:30 (id: 942008030)

30Then Jesus questioned him, “What is your name?” and he said, “Legion,” for many demons had entered into him.


## Luke 8:31 (id: 942008031)

31And they were begging him that he would not command them to go away into the abyss.


## Luke 8:32 (id: 942008032)

32And a large herd of pigs was there feeding on the hillside, and they begged him to permit them to go into them. And he permitted them.


## Luke 8:33 (id: 942008033)

33Then the demons, having come out from the man, entered into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep slope into the lake and was drowned.


## Luke 8:34 (id: 942008034)

34And having seen what had happened, the ones tending the pigs ran away and reported it in the city and in the countryside.


## Luke 8:35 (id: 942008035)

35Then they went out to see what had happened, and they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone out sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and being sound\-minded, and they were afraid.


## Luke 8:36 (id: 942008036)

36Then the ones having seen reported to them how the one having been possessed by demons had been saved.


## Luke 8:37 (id: 942008037)

37And all the multitude of the region of the Gerasenes asked him to depart from them, for they were seized by great fear. Then he got into the boat to return.


## Luke 8:38 (id: 942008038)

38And the man from whom the demons had gone out begged him to be with him, but he sent him away, saying,


## Luke 8:39 (id: 942008039)

39“Return to your house and describe all that God has done for you.” So he went on his way, proclaiming throughout the whole city all that Jesus had done for him.


## Luke 8:40 (id: 942008040)

40Then when Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed him, for they were all expecting him.


## Luke 8:41 (id: 942008041)

41And behold, a man came whose name {was} Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue. And falling at the feet of Jesus, he begged him to come to his house,


## Luke 8:42 (id: 942008042)

42because he {had} a one and only daughter, who was about 12 years old, and she was dying. And as he was going, the crowds were crowding around him.


## Luke 8:43 (id: 942008043)

43And a woman, being with a flow of blood for 12 years, who, having spent all her living on doctors, was not able to be healed by anyone,


## Luke 8:44 (id: 942008044)

44having approached from behind, touched the edge of his cloak, and immediately her flow of blood stopped.


## Luke 8:45 (id: 942008045)

45And Jesus said, “Who {is} the one having touched me?” But {when} all denied it, Peter said, “Master, the crowds are crowding around and pressing against you.”


## Luke 8:46 (id: 942008046)

46But Jesus said, “Someone touched me, for I know power has gone out from me.”


## Luke 8:47 (id: 942008047)

47Then the woman, having seen that she could not hide, came trembling and having fallen down before him, she declared before all the people for what reason she had touched him, and how she had been healed immediately.


## Luke 8:48 (id: 942008048)

48Then he said to her, “Daughter, your faith has saved you. Go in peace.”


## Luke 8:49 (id: 942008049)

49He still speaking, someone comes from the synagogue leader, saying, “Your daughter has died. Do not trouble the Teacher any longer.”


## Luke 8:50 (id: 942008050)

50But Jesus, having heard this, answered him, “Do not fear; only believe, and she will be saved.”


## Luke 8:51 (id: 942008051)

51And having come to the house, he did not allow anyone to enter with him, except Peter and John and James, and the father of the child, and the mother.


## Luke 8:52 (id: 942008052)

52And they were all mourning and beating their breasts for her, but he said, “Do not wail, for she has not died, but sleeps.”


## Luke 8:53 (id: 942008053)

53And they were laughing at him, knowing that she had died.


## Luke 8:54 (id: 942008054)

54But he, having taken her hand, called out, saying, “Child, arise!”


## Luke 8:55 (id: 942008055)

55And her spirit returned, and she rose up immediately, and he ordered something to be given to her to eat.


## Luke 8:56 (id: 942008056)

56And her parents were astonished, but he commanded them to tell no one what had happened.


## Luke 9:1 (id: 942009001)

1And having called the Twelve together, he gave them power and authority over all the demons, and to cure diseases,


## Luke 9:2 (id: 942009002)

2and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.


## Luke 9:3 (id: 942009003)

3And he said to them, “Take nothing for the road—neither staff, nor bag, nor bread, nor silver—nor have two tunics.


## Luke 9:4 (id: 942009004)

4And whatever house you enter into, stay there and go out from there.


## Luke 9:5 (id: 942009005)

5And wherever they do not receive you, going out from that city, shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony against them.”


## Luke 9:6 (id: 942009006)

6Then they went out {and} were going through the villages, proclaiming the gospel and healing everywhere.


## Luke 9:7 (id: 942009007)

7And Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was happening, and he was perplexed, because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead,


## Luke 9:8 (id: 942009008)

8and by some that Elijah had appeared, but by others that one of the ancient prophets had risen.


## Luke 9:9 (id: 942009009)

9But Herod said, “I beheaded John, but who is this about whom I hear such things?” So he was seeking to see him.


## Luke 9:10 (id: 942009010)

10And the apostles, having returned, described to him as much as they had done. Then taking them, he withdrew by himself to a city called Bethsaida.


## Luke 9:11 (id: 942009011)

11But the crowds, having come to know, followed him. And he welcomed them {and} spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and he was healing the ones having need of healing.


## Luke 9:12 (id: 942009012)

12And the day began to end, and the Twelve, having come, said to him, “Send the crowd away so that, going into the surrounding villages and countryside, they may find lodging and food, because we are here in a desolate place.”


## Luke 9:13 (id: 942009013)

13But he said to them, “You give them to eat.” But they said, “There are not more than five loaves and two fish with us—unless we go {and} buy food for all these people.”


## Luke 9:14 (id: 942009014)

14(For there were about 5,000 men.) Then he said to his disciples, “Have them recline to eat in groups of about 50 each.”


## Luke 9:15 (id: 942009015)

15And thus they did, and made {them} all recline to eat.


## Luke 9:16 (id: 942009016)

16Then having taken the five loaves and the two fish, having looked up to heaven, he blessed them and broke {them} into pieces, and he was giving them to the disciples to set before the crowd.


## Luke 9:17 (id: 942009017)

17And they all ate and were satisfied, and what was left over to them was picked up—12 baskets of broken pieces.


## Luke 9:18 (id: 942009018)

18And it happened that, while he was praying alone, the disciples were with him, and he questioned them, saying, “Who do the crowds say that I am?”


## Luke 9:19 (id: 942009019)

19So answering, they said, “John the Baptist, but others Elijah, and others that one of the ancient prophets has risen.”


## Luke 9:20 (id: 942009020)

20Then he said to them, “But who do you say that I am?” Then Peter answering said, “The Christ of God.”


## Luke 9:21 (id: 942009021)

21But he, strongly warning them, commanded {them} to tell this to no one,


## Luke 9:22 (id: 942009022)

22saying, “It is necessary for the Son of Man to suffer many things and to be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and to be killed, and to be raised on the third day.”


## Luke 9:23 (id: 942009023)

23Then he said to {them} all, “If anyone wants to come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me.


## Luke 9:24 (id: 942009024)

24For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake, this one will save it.


## Luke 9:25 (id: 942009025)

25For what does a man benefit, having gained the whole world, but losing or forfeiting himself?


## Luke 9:26 (id: 942009026)

26For whoever is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of this one when he comes in his own glory, and of the Father and of the holy angels.


## Luke 9:27 (id: 942009027)

27But I say to you truly, there are some of the ones standing here who will certainly not taste death until they see the kingdom of God.”


## Luke 9:28 (id: 942009028)

28And it happened that, about eight days after these words, taking along Peter and John and James, he went up on the mountain to pray.


## Luke 9:29 (id: 942009029)

29And it happened that, as he was praying, the appearance of his face became different, and his clothing flashed white like lightning.


## Luke 9:30 (id: 942009030)

30And behold, two men began talking with him, who were Moses and Elijah,


## Luke 9:31 (id: 942009031)

31who were seen in glory, speaking about his departure, which he was about to fulfill in Jerusalem.


## Luke 9:32 (id: 942009032)

32And Peter and the ones with him were weighted with sleep, but having become fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men standing with him.


## Luke 9:33 (id: 942009033)

33And it happened that, as they were going away from him, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is good for us to be here, and let us make three tents, one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah” (not knowing what he says).


## Luke 9:34 (id: 942009034)

34But as he was saying these things, a cloud appeared and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered into the cloud.


## Luke 9:35 (id: 942009035)

35And there was a voice from the cloud, saying, “This is my Son, the chosen one; listen to him.”


## Luke 9:36 (id: 942009036)

36And when the voice had happened, Jesus was found alone. Then they were silent and told no one in those days anything of {the things} they had seen.


## Luke 9:37 (id: 942009037)

37And it happened that, on the next day, they having come down from the mountain, a large crowd met him.


## Luke 9:38 (id: 942009038)

38And behold, a man from the crowd cried out, saying, “Teacher, I beg you to look upon my son, for he is my one and only {child}.


## Luke 9:39 (id: 942009039)

39And behold, a spirit seizes him and he suddenly cries out, and it throws him into convulsions with foam. And it departs from him with difficulty, crushing him.


## Luke 9:40 (id: 942009040)

40And I begged your disciples so that they would cast it out, and they were not able.”


## Luke 9:41 (id: 942009041)

41But answering, Jesus said, “O unbelieving and perverted generation, until when will I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.”


## Luke 9:42 (id: 942009042)

42And while he was coming, the demon threw him down and shook {him} with convulsions. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the boy and gave him back to his father.


## Luke 9:43 (id: 942009043)

43Then they were all amazed at the majesty of God. But {while} all were marveling at everything that he was doing, he said to his disciples,


## Luke 9:44 (id: 942009044)

44“You put these words in your ears: For the Son of Man is about to be handed over into the hands of men.”


## Luke 9:45 (id: 942009045)

45But they were not understanding this word, and it was hidden from them, so they could not understand it, and they were afraid to question him about this word.


## Luke 9:46 (id: 942009046)

46Then an argument started among them as to which of them might be the greatest.


## Luke 9:47 (id: 942009047)

47But Jesus, knowing the reasoning in their hearts, having taken a little child, set him next to him,


## Luke 9:48 (id: 942009048)

48and said to them, “Whoever receives this child in my name, receives me, and whoever receives me, receives the one having sent me. For the one being least among you all, he is great.”


## Luke 9:49 (id: 942009049)

49Then answering, John said, “Master, we saw someone casting out demons in your name and we were preventing him, because he does not follow with us.”


## Luke 9:50 (id: 942009050)

50But Jesus said to him, “Do not prevent {him}, for whoever is not against you is for you.”


## Luke 9:51 (id: 942009051)

51And it happened that, when the days of his being taken up were being fulfilled, then he set his face to go to Jerusalem.


## Luke 9:52 (id: 942009052)

52And he sent messengers before his face, and they went {and} entered into a Samaritan village so as to prepare for him.


## Luke 9:53 (id: 942009053)

53But they did not welcome him, because his face was going to Jerusalem.


## Luke 9:54 (id: 942009054)

54And the disciples James and John, having seen this, said, “Lord, do you want us to tell fire to come down from heaven and consume them?”


## Luke 9:55 (id: 942009055)

55But having turned, he rebuked them,


## Luke 9:56 (id: 942009056)

56and they went on to another village.


## Luke 9:57 (id: 942009057)

57And as they were going along the road, someone said to him, “I will follow you wherever you go.”


## Luke 9:58 (id: 942009058)

58And Jesus said to him, “The foxes have dens, and the birds of the sky, nests, but the Son of Man does not have {a place} where he might lay his head.”


## Luke 9:59 (id: 942009059)

59Then he said to another, “Follow me.” But he said, “Lord, permit me to go first to bury my father.”


## Luke 9:60 (id: 942009060)

60But he said to him, “Let the dead bury their own dead. But you, go {and} proclaim the kingdom of God.”


## Luke 9:61 (id: 942009061)

61Then still another said, “I will follow you, Lord, but first permit me to say goodbye to the ones in my home.”


## Luke 9:62 (id: 942009062)

62But Jesus replied, “No one, having put his hand on a plow, yet looking to the things behind, is fit for the kingdom of God.”


## Luke 10:1 (id: 942010001)

1And after these things, the Lord also appointed 72 others, and sent them out by twos before his face to every city and place where he himself was about to go.


## Luke 10:2 (id: 942010002)

2And he said to them, “Indeed the harvest {is} plentiful, but the laborers {are} few. Therefore, earnestly ask the Lord of the harvest, so that he would send out laborers into his harvest.


## Luke 10:3 (id: 942010003)

3Go. Behold, I send you out as lambs in the midst of wolves.


## Luke 10:4 (id: 942010004)

4Do not carry a money bag, nor a sack, nor sandals, and greet no one on the road.


## Luke 10:5 (id: 942010005)

5Whatever house you enter into, first say, ‘Peace {be} to this house!’


## Luke 10:6 (id: 942010006)

6And if a son of peace is there, your peace will rest upon him; but if not, it will return to you.


## Luke 10:7 (id: 942010007)

7And remain in that house, eating and drinking {what is} from them, for the laborer {is} worthy of his wages. Do not move around from house to house.


## Luke 10:8 (id: 942010008)

8And whatever city you enter into, and they receive you, eat {what} is served to you,


## Luke 10:9 (id: 942010009)

9and heal the sick in it, and say to them, ‘The kingdom of God has come close to you.’


## Luke 10:10 (id: 942010010)

10And into whatever city you enter, and they do not receive you, go out into its streets {and} say,


## Luke 10:11 (id: 942010011)

11‘Even the dust that clings to us from your city on our feet we wipe off against you! But know this, that the kingdom of God has come near.’


## Luke 10:12 (id: 942010012)

12I say to you that on that day it will be more tolerable for Sodom than for that city.


## Luke 10:13 (id: 942010013)

13Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles had happened in Tyre and Sidon which happened in you, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.


## Luke 10:14 (id: 942010014)

14But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and for Sidon at the judgment than for you.


## Luke 10:15 (id: 942010015)

15And you, Capernaum, you will not be exalted to heaven, will you? You will be brought down as far as Hades.


## Luke 10:16 (id: 942010016)

16The one listening to you listens to me, and the one rejecting you rejects me, and the one rejecting me rejects the one having sent me.”


## Luke 10:17 (id: 942010017)

17Then the 72 returned with joy, saying, “Lord, even the demons are subjected to us in your name.”


## Luke 10:18 (id: 942010018)

18And he said to them, “I was watching Satan fall from heaven like lightning.


## Luke 10:19 (id: 942010019)

19Behold, I have given you authority to tread on snakes and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing will harm you at all.


## Luke 10:20 (id: 942010020)

20Nevertheless, do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subjected to you, but rejoice that your names are written in the heavens.”


## Luke 10:21 (id: 942010021)

21At that hour he rejoiced greatly in the Holy Spirit, and said, “I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you concealed these things from the wise and intelligent and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for thus it was well\-pleasing before you.


## Luke 10:22 (id: 942010022)

22All things have been handed over to me by my Father, and no one knows who the Son is except the Father, and who the Father is except the Son, and to whomever the Son desires to reveal him.”


## Luke 10:23 (id: 942010023)

23And having turned around to the disciples, he said privately, “Blessed {are} the eyes that see what you see!


## Luke 10:24 (id: 942010024)

24For I say to you that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see, and did not see, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear.”


## Luke 10:25 (id: 942010025)

25And behold, a certain lawyer stood up, testing him, saying, “Teacher, doing what, will I inherit eternal life?”


## Luke 10:26 (id: 942010026)

26But he said to him, “What is written in the law? How do you read {it}?”


## Luke 10:27 (id: 942010027)

27And answering, he said, “You will love the Lord your God from your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole strength and with your whole mind, and your neighbor as yourself.”


## Luke 10:28 (id: 942010028)

28And he said to him, “You have answered correctly. Do this, and you will live.”


## Luke 10:29 (id: 942010029)

29But he, desiring to justify himself, said to Jesus, “And who is my neighbor?”


## Luke 10:30 (id: 942010030)

30Then answering, Jesus said, “A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among robbers {who}, both having stripped him and having laid on blows, went away, leaving him half dead.


## Luke 10:31 (id: 942010031)

31Then by coincidence a certain priest was going down on that road, and having seen him, he passed by on the other side.


## Luke 10:32 (id: 942010032)

32And likewise a Levite also, having come to the place and having seen {him}, passed by on the other side.


## Luke 10:33 (id: 942010033)

33But a certain Samaritan, as he traveled along, came upon him, and having seen {him}, he felt compassion.


## Luke 10:34 (id: 942010034)

34And having approached, he bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then, having put him on his own animal, he brought him to an inn and took care of him.


## Luke 10:35 (id: 942010035)

35And on the next day, taking out two denarii, he gave them to the innkeeper and said, ‘Take care of him, and whatever more you spend, when I return, I will repay you.’


## Luke 10:36 (id: 942010036)

36Which of these three do you think became a neighbor to the one having fallen among the robbers?”


## Luke 10:37 (id: 942010037)

37And he said, “The one having shown mercy to him.” Then Jesus said to him, “You go and do likewise.”


## Luke 10:38 (id: 942010038)

38And as they were traveling along, he entered into a certain village, and a certain woman named Martha welcomed him.


## Luke 10:39 (id: 942010039)

39And she had a sister called Mary, and she was sitting at the feet of Jesus, listening to his word.


## Luke 10:40 (id: 942010040)

40But Martha was distracted with much service, and coming up, she said, “Lord, are you not concerned that my sister has left me alone to serve? Therefore, speak to her so that she might help me.”


## Luke 10:41 (id: 942010041)

41But answering, the Lord said to her, “Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things,


## Luke 10:42 (id: 942010042)

42but one thing is necessary. For Mary has chosen the good part, which will not be taken away from her.”


## Luke 11:1 (id: 942011001)

1And it happened that, when he was praying in a certain place, when he stopped, one of his disciples said to him, “Lord, teach us to pray, just as John also taught his disciples.”


## Luke 11:2 (id: 942011002)

2And he said to them, “When you pray, say, ‘Father, let your name be made holy. Let your kingdom come.


## Luke 11:3 (id: 942011003)

3Give us our daily bread each day.


## Luke 11:4 (id: 942011004)

4And forgive us our sins, for we also forgive everyone owing us. And do not bring us into temptation.’”


## Luke 11:5 (id: 942011005)

5And he said to them, “Which of you will have a friend and will go to him at midnight and say to him, ‘Friend, lend three loaves to me,


## Luke 11:6 (id: 942011006)

6since my friend has come to me from the road, and I do not have anything to serve to him’?


## Luke 11:7 (id: 942011007)

7And answering from inside, he may say, ‘Do not cause me trouble. The door has already been shut, and my children are in the bed with me. I am not able to get up to give to you.’


## Luke 11:8 (id: 942011008)

8I say to you, even if he does not get up to give {it} to him because he is his friend, yet because of his persistence, rising up, he will give to him as much as he needs.


## Luke 11:9 (id: 942011009)

9I also say to you, ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.


## Luke 11:10 (id: 942011010)

10For everyone asking receives; and the one seeking finds; and to the one knocking, it will be opened.


## Luke 11:11 (id: 942011011)

11And which father among you, his son will ask for a fish, and instead of a fish, he will give him a snake?


## Luke 11:12 (id: 942011012)

12Or also he will ask for an egg, he will give him a scorpion?


## Luke 11:13 (id: 942011013)

13Therefore, if you being evil know to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the Father from heaven give the Holy Spirit to the ones asking him?”


## Luke 11:14 (id: 942011014)

14And he was casting out a mute demon. And it happened that, the demon having gone out, the mute {man} spoke, and the crowds marveled.


## Luke 11:15 (id: 942011015)

15But some of them said, “By Beelzebul, the ruler of demons, he casts out the demons.”


## Luke 11:16 (id: 942011016)

16And others tested {him}, seeking from him a sign from heaven.


## Luke 11:17 (id: 942011017)

17But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself is made desolate, and house against house falls.


## Luke 11:18 (id: 942011018)

18But if Satan is also divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say I cast out the demons by Beelzebul.


## Luke 11:19 (id: 942011019)

19But if I cast out the demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Because of this, they will be your judges.


## Luke 11:20 (id: 942011020)

20But if I cast out the demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.


## Luke 11:21 (id: 942011021)

21When the strong man {who} has been fully armed is guarding his own courtyard, his possessions are at peace,


## Luke 11:22 (id: 942011022)

22but when a stronger than he attacks him, he will overcome him, take away his armor in which he trusted, and divide his spoils.


## Luke 11:23 (id: 942011023)

23The one not being with me is against me, and the one not gathering with me scatters.


## Luke 11:24 (id: 942011024)

24When the unclean spirit has gone out from the man, it passes through waterless places seeking rest, and not finding any, it says, ‘I will return to my house from which I came out.’


## Luke 11:25 (id: 942011025)

25And having come, it finds {it} having been swept out and put in order.


## Luke 11:26 (id: 942011026)

26Then it goes and takes along seven other spirits more evil than itself and they having entered, it resides there. And the last things of that man become worse than the first things.”


## Luke 11:27 (id: 942011027)

27And it happened that, as he was saying these things, a certain woman from the crowd, lifting up her voice, said to him, “Blessed {is} the womb that bore you and the breasts that you nursed at.”


## Luke 11:28 (id: 942011028)

28But he said, “Rather, blessed {are} the ones hearing the word of God and keeping {it}.”


## Luke 11:29 (id: 942011029)

29And as the crowds were increasing, he began to say, “This generation is an evil generation. It seeks a sign, but a sign will not be given to it except the sign of Jonah.


## Luke 11:30 (id: 942011030)

30For as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so also will the Son of Man be to this generation.


## Luke 11:31 (id: 942011031)

31The Queen of the South will stand up in the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon {is} here.


## Luke 11:32 (id: 942011032)

32The men of Nineveh will rise up in the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah {is} here.


## Luke 11:33 (id: 942011033)

33No one, having lit a lamp, puts {it} in a hidden place, nor under the measure, but on the lampstand, so that the ones entering may see the light.


## Luke 11:34 (id: 942011034)

34The lamp of the body is your eye. When your eye is healthy, your whole body is also illuminated. But when it is evil, your body {is} also dark.


## Luke 11:35 (id: 942011035)

35Therefore, beware that the light {that is} in you is not darkness.


## Luke 11:36 (id: 942011036)

36If therefore your whole body {is} illuminated, not having any part dark, it will all be illuminated, as when the lamp with {its} brightness illuminates you.”


## Luke 11:37 (id: 942011037)

37And when he had spoken, a Pharisee asks him that he would dine with him. And having gone in, he reclined to eat.


## Luke 11:38 (id: 942011038)

38And the Pharisee, having seen this, marveled that he did not first wash before the meal.


## Luke 11:39 (id: 942011039)

39But the Lord said to him, “Now you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and of the bowl, but the inside of you is full of greed and evil.


## Luke 11:40 (id: 942011040)

40You foolish ones! Did not the one having made the outside also make the inside?


## Luke 11:41 (id: 942011041)

41But give as charity {what} is inside, and behold, all things are clean to you.


## Luke 11:42 (id: 942011042)

42But woe to you Pharisees, because you tithe the mint and the rue and every garden herb, but you neglect the justice and the love of God. But it was necessary to do these and those not to neglect.


## Luke 11:43 (id: 942011043)

43Woe to you Pharisees, for you love the first seats in the synagogues and the greetings in the marketplaces.


## Luke 11:44 (id: 942011044)

44Woe to you, for you are like the unseen graves, and the men walking over them do not know it.”


## Luke 11:45 (id: 942011045)

45Then answering, one of the lawyers says to him, “Teacher, saying these things, you insult us too.”


## Luke 11:46 (id: 942011046)

46But he said, “Woe also to you lawyers! For you burden men with burdens difficult to carry, but you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers.


## Luke 11:47 (id: 942011047)

47Woe to you, because you build the tombs of the prophets, but your fathers killed them.


## Luke 11:48 (id: 942011048)

48So you testify and consent to the works of your fathers, for they indeed killed them, but you are building.


## Luke 11:49 (id: 942011049)

49Because of this, the wisdom of God also said, ‘I will send to them prophets and apostles, and some of them they will kill and persecute’


## Luke 11:50 (id: 942011050)

50that the blood of all the prophets having been shed from the foundation of the world may be required from this generation,


## Luke 11:51 (id: 942011051)

51from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, the one having perished between the altar and the house. Yes, I say to you, it will be required from this generation.


## Luke 11:52 (id: 942011052)

52Woe to you lawyers, because you have taken away the key of knowledge; you have not entered yourselves, and you have hindered the ones entering.”


## Luke 11:53 (id: 942011053)

53{After} he went out from there, the scribes and the Pharisees began to oppose him fiercely and to argue against him about many things,


## Luke 11:54 (id: 942011054)

54lying in wait for him to trap something from his mouth.


## Luke 12:1 (id: 942012001)

1When myriads of the crowd were gathered together so that they trampled on each other, he began to say to his disciples first, “Guard yourselves from the yeast of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.


## Luke 12:2 (id: 942012002)

2But nothing is concealed that will not be revealed, and hidden, that will not be known.


## Luke 12:3 (id: 942012003)

3Therefore, whatever you have said in the darkness will be heard in the light, and what you have spoken in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed upon the housetops.


## Luke 12:4 (id: 942012004)

4But I say to you, my friends, you should not be afraid of the ones killing the body, and after that not having anything more to do.


## Luke 12:5 (id: 942012005)

5But I will show you whom to fear. Fear the one, after he has killed, having authority to throw into Gehenna. Yes, I say to you, fear him.


## Luke 12:6 (id: 942012006)

6Are not five sparrows sold for two assaria? Yet not one of them is forgotten before God.


## Luke 12:7 (id: 942012007)

7But even the hairs of your head have all been numbered. Do not fear: you are more valuable than many sparrows.


## Luke 12:8 (id: 942012008)

8But I say to you, everyone who confesses about me before men, the Son of Man will also confess about him before the angels of God,


## Luke 12:9 (id: 942012009)

9but the one having denied me before men will be denied before the angels of God.


## Luke 12:10 (id: 942012010)

10And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him, but to the one having blasphemed against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven.


## Luke 12:11 (id: 942012011)

11And when they bring you to the synagogues and the rulers and the authorities, do not worry about how or what you should speak in your defense or what you should say,


## Luke 12:12 (id: 942012012)

12for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that hour what is necessary to say.”


## Luke 12:13 (id: 942012013)

13Then someone from the crowd said to him, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.”


## Luke 12:14 (id: 942012014)

14But he said to him, “Man, who appointed me a judge or a mediator over you?”


## Luke 12:15 (id: 942012015)

15Then he said to them, “See and keep yourselves from all covetousness, because one’s life is not in the abounding to him of his possessions.”


## Luke 12:16 (id: 942012016)

16Then he spoke to them a parable, saying, “The land of a certain rich man yielded abundantly,


## Luke 12:17 (id: 942012017)

17and he reasoned with himself, saying, ‘What should I do, since I do not have anywhere to gather my crops?’


## Luke 12:18 (id: 942012018)

18And he said, ‘I will do this: I will take down my barns and build bigger ones, and there I will gather all of my grain and good things.


## Luke 12:19 (id: 942012019)

19And I will say to my soul, “Soul, you have many good things lying in store for many years. Relax, eat, drink, be merry.”’


## Luke 12:20 (id: 942012020)

20But God said to him, ‘Foolish one, this night they are demanding your soul from you, and what you have prepared, whose will it be?’


## Luke 12:21 (id: 942012021)

21Thus {is} the one storing up treasure for himself, and not being rich toward God.”


## Luke 12:22 (id: 942012022)

22Then he said to his disciples, “Because of this I say to you, do not worry about your life, what you might eat, nor about your body, what you might wear.


## Luke 12:23 (id: 942012023)

23For life is more than food, and the body {than} clothing.


## Luke 12:24 (id: 942012024)

24Consider the ravens, that they do not sow nor reap, to whom is neither storeroom nor barn, but God feeds them. How much more valuable you are than the birds!


## Luke 12:25 (id: 942012025)

25But which of you, being anxious, is able to add a cubit to his lifespan?


## Luke 12:26 (id: 942012026)

26If then you are not able to do the least, why do you worry about the rest?


## Luke 12:27 (id: 942012027)

27Consider the lilies—how they grow. They do not labor, neither do they spin. But I say to you, not even Solomon in all his glory clothed himself like one of these.


## Luke 12:28 (id: 942012028)

28And if God thus clothes the grass in the field, existing today and tomorrow being thrown into an oven, how much more you, ones of little faith!


## Luke 12:29 (id: 942012029)

29And you, do not seek what you might eat and what you might drink, and do not be anxious.


## Luke 12:30 (id: 942012030)

30For all the nations of the world seek these things, but your Father knows that you need them.


## Luke 12:31 (id: 942012031)

31But seek his kingdom, and these things will be added to you.


## Luke 12:32 (id: 942012032)

32Do not fear, little flock, because your Father is very pleased to give you the kingdom.


## Luke 12:33 (id: 942012033)

33Sell your possessions and give alms. Make for yourselves purses that do not wear out—unfailing treasure in the heavens, where thief does not come near, nor moth destroy.


## Luke 12:34 (id: 942012034)

34For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.


## Luke 12:35 (id: 942012035)

35Let your loins be girded, and the lamps be kept burning,


## Luke 12:36 (id: 942012036)

36and you {be} like men waiting for their master when he returns from the wedding feast, so that {when} he comes and knocks, they may immediately open for him.


## Luke 12:37 (id: 942012037)

37Blessed {are} those servants whom the master will find watching {when} he comes. Truly I say to you that he will gird himself and have them recline to eat, and he will come {and} serve them.


## Luke 12:38 (id: 942012038)

38Even if he comes in the second, or even in the third watch, and finds them thus, blessed are those.


## Luke 12:39 (id: 942012039)

39But know this, that if the master of the house had known at which hour the thief comes, he would not have let his house be broken into.


## Luke 12:40 (id: 942012040)

40You also be ready, because in that hour you do not think, the Son of Man comes.”


## Luke 12:41 (id: 942012041)

41Then Peter said, “Lord, are you speaking this parable to us, or also to everyone?”


## Luke 12:42 (id: 942012042)

42And the Lord said, “Who then is the faithful, wise manager whom the master will appoint over his care to give them their portion of food in time?


## Luke 12:43 (id: 942012043)

43Blessed {is} that slave whom his master, having come, will find doing thus.


## Luke 12:44 (id: 942012044)

44Truly I say to you that he will appoint him over all his possessions.


## Luke 12:45 (id: 942012045)

45But if that slave says in his heart, ‘My master delays to come,’ and he begins to beat the male servants and the female servants, and to eat and drink, and to become drunk,


## Luke 12:46 (id: 942012046)

46the master of that slave will come on a day that he does not expect and at an hour that he does not know, and he will cut him in two and appoint his place with the unfaithful.


## Luke 12:47 (id: 942012047)

47Now that slave, the one having known the will of his master and not having gotten ready or having done according to his will, will be beaten much.


## Luke 12:48 (id: 942012048)

48But the one not having known and having done things worthy of blows will be beaten little. But everyone to whom much has been given, much will be required from him, and to whom much has been provided, even more will be asked of him.


## Luke 12:49 (id: 942012049)

49I came to throw fire upon the earth, and how I wish that it were already kindled!


## Luke 12:50 (id: 942012050)

50But I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how I am distressed until it is completed!


## Luke 12:51 (id: 942012051)

51Do you think that I came to give peace on the earth? No, I say to you, but rather division.


## Luke 12:52 (id: 942012052)

52For from now on there will be five in one house divided—three against two and two against three.


## Luke 12:53 (id: 942012053)

53They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against her daughter and daughter against her mother, mother\-in\-law against her daughter\-in\-law and daughter\-in\-law against her mother\-in\-law.”


## Luke 12:54 (id: 942012054)

54And he was also saying to the crowds, “When you see a cloud rising in the west, immediately you say, ‘A shower is coming,’ and it happens thus.


## Luke 12:55 (id: 942012055)

55And when a south wind is blowing, you say, ‘There will be scorching heat,’ and it happens.


## Luke 12:56 (id: 942012056)

56Hypocrites! You know how to interpret the face of the sky and of the earth, but how do you not know how to interpret this time?


## Luke 12:57 (id: 942012057)

57And why do you not even judge for yourselves {what is} righteous?


## Luke 12:58 (id: 942012058)

58For as you are going with your adversary to a magistrate, make an effort on the way to be released from him so that he might not drag you to the judge, and the judge hand you over to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison.


## Luke 12:59 (id: 942012059)

59I say to you, you will certainly not come out from there until you have paid the very last lepton.”


## Luke 13:1 (id: 942013001)

1And some were present at that time reporting to him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices.


## Luke 13:2 (id: 942013002)

2And answering, he said to them, “Do you think that these Galileans were more sinful than all the Galileans because they suffered this?


## Luke 13:3 (id: 942013003)

3No, I say to you. But if you do not repent, you will all perish in the same way.


## Luke 13:4 (id: 942013004)

4Or those 18 on whom the tower fell in Siloam and killed them: Do you think that they were worse debtors than all the men residing in Jerusalem?


## Luke 13:5 (id: 942013005)

5No, I say to you. But if you do not repent, you will all likewise perish.”


## Luke 13:6 (id: 942013006)

6Then he spoke this parable: “Someone had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit on it, but did not find any.


## Luke 13:7 (id: 942013007)

7And he said to the gardener, ‘Behold, for three years I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree and have not found any. Cut it down. For what {reason} is it even idling the ground?’


## Luke 13:8 (id: 942013008)

8But answering, he says to him, ‘Master, leave it this year also, until I dig around it and put on manure.


## Luke 13:9 (id: 942013009)

9If it indeed bears fruit in the coming one … but if not, you will cut it down!’”


## Luke 13:10 (id: 942013010)

10And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbaths,


## Luke 13:11 (id: 942013011)

11and behold, a woman having a spirit of weakness for 18 years, and she was bent over and was not able to straighten up to the complete.


## Luke 13:12 (id: 942013012)

12And having seen her, Jesus called her over and said to her, “Woman, you are released from your weakness.”


## Luke 13:13 (id: 942013013)

13And he placed his hands on her, and immediately she was straightened up, and she glorified God.


## Luke 13:14 (id: 942013014)

14But answering, the synagogue ruler, being indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, said to the crowd, “There are six days on which it is necessary to work. Therefore come {and} be healed on them, and not on the day of the Sabbath.”


## Luke 13:15 (id: 942013015)

15But the Lord answered him and said, “Hypocrites! Does not each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or donkey from the stall and lead it away to drink?


## Luke 13:16 (id: 942013016)

16But this one, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan bound, behold, for 18 years, ought she not to have been released from this bond on the day of the Sabbath?”


## Luke 13:17 (id: 942013017)

17And {as} he was saying these things, all the ones opposing him were put to shame, but the whole crowd was rejoicing at all the glorious things being done by him.


## Luke 13:18 (id: 942013018)

18Then he said, “What is the kingdom of God like, and to what will I compare it?


## Luke 13:19 (id: 942013019)

19It is like a mustard seed that a man took {and} threw into his garden, and it grew and became a tree, and the birds of the sky nested in its branches.”


## Luke 13:20 (id: 942013020)

20And again he said, “To what will I compare the kingdom of God?


## Luke 13:21 (id: 942013021)

21It is like yeast that a woman, having taken, mixed with three seahs of flour until it was all leavened.”


## Luke 13:22 (id: 942013022)

22And he was traveling through cities and villages, teaching and making his journey toward Jerusalem.


## Luke 13:23 (id: 942013023)

23And someone said to him, “Lord, if the ones being saved {are} few?” And he said to them,


## Luke 13:24 (id: 942013024)

24“Struggle to enter through the narrow door, because many, I say to you, will seek to enter, but will not be able.


## Luke 13:25 (id: 942013025)

25After the master of the house gets up and closes the door, then you will begin to stand outside and to knock on the door, saying, ‘Lord, open for us.’ But he will answer {and} say to you, ‘I do not know you, where you are from.’


## Luke 13:26 (id: 942013026)

26Then you will begin to say, ‘We ate and drank before you, and you taught in our streets.’


## Luke 13:27 (id: 942013027)

27And he will speak, saying to you, ‘I do not know where you are from. Get away from me, all you workers of unrighteousness!’


## Luke 13:28 (id: 942013028)

28In that place, there will be wailing and the grinding of teeth when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but you are thrown outside.


## Luke 13:29 (id: 942013029)

29And they will come from east and west and from north and south and will recline to eat in the kingdom of God.


## Luke 13:30 (id: 942013030)

30And behold, there are last ones who will be first, and there are first ones who will be last.”


## Luke 13:31 (id: 942013031)

31At that hour, certain Pharisees approached, saying to him, “Leave and go away from here, because Herod wants to kill you.”


## Luke 13:32 (id: 942013032)

32And he said to them, “Go {and} tell that fox, ‘Behold, I am casting out demons and performing healings today and tomorrow, and on the third {day} I will be finished.’


## Luke 13:33 (id: 942013033)

33Nevertheless, it is necessary for me to journey today, and tomorrow, and the following {day}, for it is not possible for a prophet to perish outside of Jerusalem.


## Luke 13:34 (id: 942013034)

34Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the one killing the prophets and stoning the ones having been sent to her! How often I desired to gather your children the way a hen her own brood under her wings, and you were not willing!


## Luke 13:35 (id: 942013035)

35Behold, your house is left to you. And I say to you, you will certainly not see me until it comes when you say, ‘Blessed is the one coming in the name of the Lord.’”


## Luke 14:1 (id: 942014001)

1And it happened that, when he went into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees on a Sabbath to eat bread, they were also watching him closely.


## Luke 14:2 (id: 942014002)

2And behold, a certain man who was edematous {was} before him.


## Luke 14:3 (id: 942014003)

3And answering, Jesus spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath, or not?”


## Luke 14:4 (id: 942014004)

4But they kept silent. And, taking hold of him, he healed him and sent him away.


## Luke 14:5 (id: 942014005)

5And he said to them, “Of which of you will a son or an ox fall into a well, and he will not immediately pull him out on the Sabbath day?”


## Luke 14:6 (id: 942014006)

6And they were not able to give an answer to these things.


## Luke 14:7 (id: 942014007)

7Then he was speaking a parable to the ones that had been invited, noticing how they were choosing the first places, {and} saying to them,


## Luke 14:8 (id: 942014008)

8“When you are invited by someone to a wedding feast, do not recline to eat in the first place, lest a more honorable than you may have been invited by him,


## Luke 14:9 (id: 942014009)

9and {when} the one having invited you and him arrives, he will say to you, ‘Give your place to this one,’ and then you will begin with shame to take the last place.


## Luke 14:10 (id: 942014010)

10But when you are invited, go {and} recline to eat in the last place, so that when the one that had invited you comes, he will say to you, ‘Friend, come up higher.’ Then there will be glory to you before all the ones reclining to eat with you.


## Luke 14:11 (id: 942014011)

11For everyone exalting himself will be humbled, and the one humbling himself will be exalted.”


## Luke 14:12 (id: 942014012)

12Then he also said to the one that had invited him, “When you make a lunch or a supper, do not invite your friends, nor your brothers, nor your relatives, nor rich neighbors, lest they also invite you in return and repayment happen to you.


## Luke 14:13 (id: 942014013)

13But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, {and the} blind,


## Luke 14:14 (id: 942014014)

14and you will be blessed, because they do not have to repay you. For it will be repaid to you in the resurrection of the righteous.”


## Luke 14:15 (id: 942014015)

15And one of the ones reclining to eat, having heard these things, said to him, “Blessed {is} whoever will eat bread in the kingdom of God!”


## Luke 14:16 (id: 942014016)

16But he said to him, “A certain man made a large supper and invited many.


## Luke 14:17 (id: 942014017)

17And he sent his servant at the hour of the supper to say to the ones that had been invited, ‘Come, because it is now ready.’


## Luke 14:18 (id: 942014018)

18And they all from one began to excuse themselves. The first said to him, ‘I have bought a field, and I have need to go out to see it. I ask you, have me excused.’


## Luke 14:19 (id: 942014019)

19And another said, ‘I have bought five pairs of oxen, and I am going to try them out. I ask you, have me excused.’


## Luke 14:20 (id: 942014020)

20And another said, ‘I have married a wife, and because of this I am not able to come.’


## Luke 14:21 (id: 942014021)

21And the servant came {and} reported these things to his master. Then becoming angry, the master of the house said to his servant, ‘Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in here the poor and crippled and blind and lame.’


## Luke 14:22 (id: 942014022)

22And the servant said, ‘Master, what you commanded has happened, and there is still room.’


## Luke 14:23 (id: 942014023)

23And the master said to the servant, ‘Go out into the roads and hedges and compel {them} to come in, so that my house may be filled.


## Luke 14:24 (id: 942014024)

24For I say to you that none of those men that had been invited will taste of my supper.’”


## Luke 14:25 (id: 942014025)

25And large crowds were journeying with him, and he turned {and} said to them,


## Luke 14:26 (id: 942014026)

26“If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters and also even his own life, he is not able to be my disciple.


## Luke 14:27 (id: 942014027)

27Whoever does not carry his cross and come after me is not able to be my disciple.


## Luke 14:28 (id: 942014028)

28For which of you, desiring to build a tower, does not first sit down {and} calculate the cost—whether he has for completion?


## Luke 14:29 (id: 942014029)

29Otherwise, he having laid a foundation and not being able to finish, all who see it will begin to mock him,


## Luke 14:30 (id: 942014030)

30saying, ‘This man began to build and was not able to finish.’


## Luke 14:31 (id: 942014031)

31Or what king, going to fight with another king in war, will not sit down {and} first determine whether he is able with 10,000 to meet the one coming against him with 20,000?


## Luke 14:32 (id: 942014032)

32But if not, while he is still far away, sending a delegation, he asks the things for peace.


## Luke 14:33 (id: 942014033)

33In the same way, then, every one of you who does not renounce all the {things that} he himself possesses is not able to be my disciple.


## Luke 14:34 (id: 942014034)

34Salt then {is} good, but if the salt indeed is made tasteless, with what will it be seasoned?


## Luke 14:35 (id: 942014035)

35It is useful neither for the soil nor for the manure pile. They throw it outside. The one having ears to hear, let him hear.”


## Luke 15:1 (id: 942015001)

1And all the tax collectors and the sinners were coming to him to listen to him.


## Luke 15:2 (id: 942015002)

2And both the Pharisees and the scribes were grumbling, saying, “This one receives sinners and eats together with them.”


## Luke 15:3 (id: 942015003)

3And he spoke this parable to them, saying,


## Luke 15:4 (id: 942015004)

4“Which man among you, having 100 sheep and having lost one of them, does not leave the 99 in the wilderness and go after the lost one until he finds it?


## Luke 15:5 (id: 942015005)

5And having found {it}, he lays {it} on his shoulders, rejoicing.


## Luke 15:6 (id: 942015006)

6And coming to the house, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, ‘Rejoice together with me, for I have found my lost sheep.’


## Luke 15:7 (id: 942015007)

7I say to you that in the same way, there will be joy in heaven over one sinner repenting, more than over 99 being righteous having no need of repentance.


## Luke 15:8 (id: 942015008)

8Or what woman, having ten drachmas, if she loses one drachma, would not light a lamp and sweep the house and seek diligently until she has found {it}?


## Luke 15:9 (id: 942015009)

9And having found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, ‘Rejoice together with me, for I have found the drachma that I lost.’


## Luke 15:10 (id: 942015010)

10In the same way, I say to you, there is joy before the angels of God over one sinner repenting.”


## Luke 15:11 (id: 942015011)

11Then he said, “A certain man had two sons,


## Luke 15:12 (id: 942015012)

12and the younger of them said to his father, ‘Father, give me the portion of the wealth that falls to {me}.’ And he distributed his livelihood to them.


## Luke 15:13 (id: 942015013)

13And after not many days, having gathered everything together, the younger son went to a distant country, and there he wasted his wealth, living recklessly.


## Luke 15:14 (id: 942015014)

14And {when} he had spent everything, a severe famine happened throughout that country, and he began to be in need.


## Luke 15:15 (id: 942015015)

15And he went {and} attached himself to one of the citizens of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed pigs.


## Luke 15:16 (id: 942015016)

16And he was longing to be satisfied from the carob pods that the pigs were eating, and no one gave to him.


## Luke 15:17 (id: 942015017)

17But coming to himself, he said, ‘How many hired servants of my father have more than enough loaves, but I am perishing from hunger here!


## Luke 15:18 (id: 942015018)

18I will get up {and} go to my father, and I will say to him, “Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you.


## Luke 15:19 (id: 942015019)

19I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me as one of your hired servants.”’


## Luke 15:20 (id: 942015020)

20And having gotten up, he went to his own father. But he being still far away, his father saw him and felt compassion, and he ran, fell upon his neck, and kissed him.


## Luke 15:21 (id: 942015021)

21Then the son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’


## Luke 15:22 (id: 942015022)

22But the father said to his servants, ‘Quickly, bring the first robe and clothe him, and put a ring on his hand, and sandals on his feet.


## Luke 15:23 (id: 942015023)

23And bring the fattened calf, kill {it}, and let us eat {and} celebrate!


## Luke 15:24 (id: 942015024)

24For this son of mine was dead, and has come back to life; he was lost, and he has been found.’ Then they began to celebrate.


## Luke 15:25 (id: 942015025)

25And his older son was in the field, and {as} he came {and} approached the house, he heard music and dancing.


## Luke 15:26 (id: 942015026)

26And summoning one of the servants, he asked what these things might be.


## Luke 15:27 (id: 942015027)

27And he said to him, ‘Your brother has come and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has received him back in good health.’


## Luke 15:28 (id: 942015028)

28But he became angry and was not willing to go in, and his father came out {and} entreated him.


## Luke 15:29 (id: 942015029)

29But answering, he said to his father, ‘Behold, for so many years I am slaving for you, and I have never disregarded your command, and you never gave a young goat to me so that I might celebrate with my friends,


## Luke 15:30 (id: 942015030)

30but when this son of yours came, the one having devoured your livelihood with prostitutes, you killed for him the fattened calf.’


## Luke 15:31 (id: 942015031)

31But he said to him, ‘Child, you are always with me, and all {that is} mine is yours.


## Luke 15:32 (id: 942015032)

32But it was proper to celebrate and to rejoice, for this brother of yours was dead, and lived, and he had been lost, and was found.’”


## Luke 16:1 (id: 942016001)

1And he also said to the disciples, “There was a certain rich man who had a manager, and he was reported to him as wasting his possessions.


## Luke 16:2 (id: 942016002)

2And having called him, he said to him, ‘What {is} this I hear about you? Give a report of your management, for you are no longer able to manage.’


## Luke 16:3 (id: 942016003)

3Then the manager said to himself, ‘What should I do, since my master is taking away the management from me? I am not strong to dig. I am ashamed to beg.


## Luke 16:4 (id: 942016004)

4I know what I will do, so that when I am removed from the management, they will welcome me into their houses.’


## Luke 16:5 (id: 942016005)

5And having summoned each one of the debtors of his master, he said to the first one, ‘How much do you owe to my master?’


## Luke 16:6 (id: 942016006)

6And he said, ‘100 baths of olive oil.’ Then he said to him, ‘Take your bill and, sitting down, quickly write 50\.’


## Luke 16:7 (id: 942016007)

7Then to another he said, ‘And you, how much do you owe?’ And he said, ‘100 cors of wheat.’ He says to him, ‘Take your bill, and write 80\.’


## Luke 16:8 (id: 942016008)

8And the master praised the unrighteous manager because he had acted shrewdly. For the sons of this age are shrewder than the sons of the light in their own generation.


## Luke 16:9 (id: 942016009)

9And I say to you, make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous wealth, so that when it fails, they may welcome you into the eternal dwellings.


## Luke 16:10 (id: 942016010)

10The one {who is} faithful in very little is also faithful in much, and the one {who is} unrighteous in very little is also unrighteous in much.


## Luke 16:11 (id: 942016011)

11If therefore you have not been faithful in unrighteous wealth, who will entrust the true to you?


## Luke 16:12 (id: 942016012)

12And if you have not been faithful in {what} belongs to another, who will give to you {what is} your own?


## Luke 16:13 (id: 942016013)

13No servant is able to serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and will love the other, or else he will be devoted to one and will despise the other. You are not able to serve God and wealth.”


## Luke 16:14 (id: 942016014)

14And the Pharisees, being lovers of money, heard all these things, and they were ridiculing him.


## Luke 16:15 (id: 942016015)

15And he said to them, “You are the ones justifying yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts. For {what is} exalted among men {is} an abomination before God.


## Luke 16:16 (id: 942016016)

16The Law and the Prophets {were} until John. From then on, the kingdom of God is proclaimed as good news, and everyone is forcing their way into it.


## Luke 16:17 (id: 942016017)

17But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one stroke of the law to fall.


## Luke 16:18 (id: 942016018)

18Everyone divorcing his wife and marrying another commits adultery, and the one marrying one that has been divorced from a husband commits adultery.


## Luke 16:19 (id: 942016019)

19Now there was a certain rich man, and he was putting on purple and fine linen, feasting sumptuously every day.


## Luke 16:20 (id: 942016020)

20But a certain poor man named Lazarus was laid at his gate, afflicted with sores,


## Luke 16:21 (id: 942016021)

21and longing to be fed from the things falling from the table of the rich man. But even the dogs were coming {and} licking his sores.


## Luke 16:22 (id: 942016022)

22Then it happened that the poor man died, and he was carried away by the angels to the bosom of Abraham. Then the rich man also died and was buried,


## Luke 16:23 (id: 942016023)

23and in Hades, lifting up his eyes, being in torment, he sees Abraham from afar, and Lazarus in his bosom.


## Luke 16:24 (id: 942016024)

24And crying out, he said, ‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am tormented in this flame.’


## Luke 16:25 (id: 942016025)

25But Abraham said, ‘Child, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, and Lazarus likewise bad things. But now he is comforted here, and you are tormented.


## Luke 16:26 (id: 942016026)

26And with all these things, between us and you a great chasm has been set in place, so that the ones wanting to cross from here to you may not be able, nor may they go across from there to us.’


## Luke 16:27 (id: 942016027)

27Then he said, ‘I beg you then, Father, that you would send him to the house of my father—


## Luke 16:28 (id: 942016028)

28for I have five brothers—in order that he might warn them, so that they may not also come to this place of torment.’


## Luke 16:29 (id: 942016029)

29But Abraham says, ‘They have Moses and the prophets; let them listen to them.’


## Luke 16:30 (id: 942016030)

30But he said, ‘No, Father Abraham, but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent.’


## Luke 16:31 (id: 942016031)

31But he said to him, ‘If they do not listen to Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded if someone rises from the dead.’”


## Luke 17:1 (id: 942017001)

1Then he said to his disciples, “It is impossible for stumbling blocks not to come, but woe {to the one} through whom they come!


## Luke 17:2 (id: 942017002)

2It would be better for him if a millstone were put around his neck and he were thrown into the sea than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble.


## Luke 17:3 (id: 942017003)

3Pay attention to yourselves. If your brother sins, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him.


## Luke 17:4 (id: 942017004)

4And if he sins against you seven times in the day, and seven times returns to you, saying, ‘I repent,’ you will forgive him.”


## Luke 17:5 (id: 942017005)

5And the apostles said to the Lord, “Increase faith to us.”


## Luke 17:6 (id: 942017006)

6So the Lord said, “If you had faith like a mustard seed, you would say to this mulberry tree, ‘Be uprooted, and be planted in the sea,’ and it would listen to you.


## Luke 17:7 (id: 942017007)

7But which of you {is it}, having a servant plowing or tending sheep, who will say to him, having come in from the field, ‘Come immediately {and} recline to eat’?


## Luke 17:8 (id: 942017008)

8Instead, will he not say to him, ‘Prepare something I may eat and, girding yourself, serve me while I eat and drink, and after these things you will eat and drink’?


## Luke 17:9 (id: 942017009)

9He does not have gratitude to the servant because he did the things commanded, does he?


## Luke 17:10 (id: 942017010)

10Thus also you, when you have done all the things commanded to you, say, ‘We are worthless servants. We have done what we ought to do.’”


## Luke 17:11 (id: 942017011)

11And it happened in the journeying to Jerusalem that he was passing through between Samaria and Galilee.


## Luke 17:12 (id: 942017012)

12And {as} he entered into a certain village, ten leprous men, who stood at a distance met {him}


## Luke 17:13 (id: 942017013)

13and they lifted up their voice, saying, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.”


## Luke 17:14 (id: 942017014)

14And having seen {them}, he said to them, “Go show yourselves to the priests.” And it happened that, as they went away, they were cleansed.


## Luke 17:15 (id: 942017015)

15Then one of them, having seen that he had been healed, returned, glorifying God with a loud voice.


## Luke 17:16 (id: 942017016)

16And he fell on his face at his feet, giving thanks to him. And he was a Samaritan.


## Luke 17:17 (id: 942017017)

17Then answering, Jesus said, “Were not ten cleansed? But where {are} the nine?


## Luke 17:18 (id: 942017018)

18Were they not found returning to give glory to God except this foreigner?”


## Luke 17:19 (id: 942017019)

19And he said to him, “Rise up, {and} go. Your faith has saved you.”


## Luke 17:20 (id: 942017020)

20And having been asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God was coming, he answered them and said, “The kingdom of God is not coming with observation.


## Luke 17:21 (id: 942017021)

21Neither will they say, ‘Behold, here!’ or ‘There!’ For behold, the kingdom of God is within you.”


## Luke 17:22 (id: 942017022)

22Then he said to the disciples, “Days will come when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not see {it}.


## Luke 17:23 (id: 942017023)

23And they will say to you, ‘Behold, there!’ or ‘Behold, here!’ Do not go out or run after them,


## Luke 17:24 (id: 942017024)

24for just as the lightning flashing from a {place} under the sky shines to a place under the sky, thus will be the Son of Man.


## Luke 17:25 (id: 942017025)

25But first it is necessary for him to suffer many things and to be rejected by this generation.


## Luke 17:26 (id: 942017026)

26And just as it happened in the days of Noah, thus it will be also in the days of the Son of Man.


## Luke 17:27 (id: 942017027)

27They were eating, they were drinking, they were marrying, they were being given in marriage—until that day Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed {them} all.


## Luke 17:28 (id: 942017028)

28Likewise, just as it happened in the days of Lot—they were eating, they were drinking, they were buying, they were selling, they were planting, they were building.


## Luke 17:29 (id: 942017029)

29But in the day Lot went out from Sodom, it rained fire and sulfur from heaven and destroyed {them} all.


## Luke 17:30 (id: 942017030)

30It will be according to these things in the day the Son of Man is revealed.


## Luke 17:31 (id: 942017031)

31In that day, whoever is on the housetop and his goods are in the house, let him not go down to take them; and the one in the field, likewise let him not turn back to the things behind.


## Luke 17:32 (id: 942017032)

32Remember the wife of Lot.


## Luke 17:33 (id: 942017033)

33Whoever seeks to keep his life will lose it, but whoever will lose {it} will preserve it.


## Luke 17:34 (id: 942017034)

34I say to you, in that night there will be two in one bed. The one will be taken, and the other will be left.


## Luke 17:35 (id: 942017035)

35There will be two grinding in the same {place}. The one will be taken, but the other will be left.”


## Luke 17:36 (id: 942017036)

36\[Two in a field; one will be taken and the other will be left.]


## Luke 17:37 (id: 942017037)

37And answering, they say to him, “Where, Lord?” So he said to them, “Where the body {is}, there also the vultures will be gathered together.”


## Luke 18:1 (id: 942018001)

1Then he spoke a parable to them to {show that} it was necessary for them always to pray and not to become discouraged,


## Luke 18:2 (id: 942018002)

2saying, “In a certain city there was a certain judge, not fearing God and not respecting man.


## Luke 18:3 (id: 942018003)

3And there was a widow in that city, and she was coming to him, saying, ‘Vindicate me against my opponent.’


## Luke 18:4 (id: 942018004)

4And for a time he was not willing, but after these things he said to himself, ‘Even if I do not fear God or respect man,


## Luke 18:5 (id: 942018005)

5yet because this widow causes me trouble, I will vindicate her, so that she will not beat me up by coming to the end.’”


## Luke 18:6 (id: 942018006)

6Then the Lord said, “Listen to what the unrighteous judge says.


## Luke 18:7 (id: 942018007)

7And will not God do the vindication of his elect, the ones crying out to him day and night, and he delays long over them?


## Luke 18:8 (id: 942018008)

8I say to you that he will do the vindication of them quickly. Nevertheless, the Son of Man having come, will he indeed find faith on the earth?”


## Luke 18:9 (id: 942018009)

9Then he also spoke this parable to some of the ones having become confident in themselves that they were righteous and disdaining others:


## Luke 18:10 (id: 942018010)

10“Two men went up into the temple to pray—the one a Pharisee, and the other a tax collector.


## Luke 18:11 (id: 942018011)

11The Pharisee, standing, was praying these things about himself, ‘God, I thank you that I am not like the rest of men—robbers, unrighteous, adulterers—or even like this tax collector.


## Luke 18:12 (id: 942018012)

12I fast twice a week. I tithe all that I acquire.’


## Luke 18:13 (id: 942018013)

13But the tax collector, standing at a distance, did not even want to lift up his eyes toward heaven, but was beating his breast, saying, ‘God, have mercy on me, the sinner.’


## Luke 18:14 (id: 942018014)

14I say to you, this one went down to his house justified rather than that one. For everyone exalting himself will be humbled, but the one humbling himself will be exalted.”


## Luke 18:15 (id: 942018015)

15And they were bringing even the infants to him so that he might touch {them}, but the disciples, having seen {it}, were rebuking them.


## Luke 18:16 (id: 942018016)

16But Jesus summoned them, saying, “Permit the little children to come to me, and do not forbid them. For of such is the kingdom of God.


## Luke 18:17 (id: 942018017)

17Truly I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a child will certainly not enter into it.”


## Luke 18:18 (id: 942018018)

18And a certain ruler asked him, saying, “Good Teacher, doing what will I inherit eternal life?”


## Luke 18:19 (id: 942018019)

19But Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one {is} good except one—God.


## Luke 18:20 (id: 942018020)

20You know the commandments—do not commit adultery, do not kill, do not steal, do not testify falsely, honor your father and mother.”


## Luke 18:21 (id: 942018021)

21But he said, “All these things I have kept from my youth.”


## Luke 18:22 (id: 942018022)

22But Jesus, hearing, said to him, “One thing is still lacking to you. Sell everything, as much as you have, and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in the heavens; and come, follow me.”


## Luke 18:23 (id: 942018023)

23But he, hearing these things, became deeply grieved, for he was very rich.


## Luke 18:24 (id: 942018024)

24Then Jesus, having looked at him, said, “How difficultly do the ones having riches enter into the kingdom of God!


## Luke 18:25 (id: 942018025)

25For it is easier for a camel to go through an eye of a needle than for a rich {person} to enter into the kingdom of God.”


## Luke 18:26 (id: 942018026)

26Then the ones having heard said, “And who is able to be saved?”


## Luke 18:27 (id: 942018027)

27But he said, “The impossible with men is possible with God.”


## Luke 18:28 (id: 942018028)

28Then Peter said, “Behold, we left everything and followed you.”


## Luke 18:29 (id: 942018029)

29So he said to them, “Truly I say to you that there is no one who has left a house or a wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God


## Luke 18:30 (id: 942018030)

30who will by no means not receive much more in this time, and in the age that is coming, eternal life.”


## Luke 18:31 (id: 942018031)

31Then having taken the Twelve aside, he said to them, “Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all the {things that} have been written by the prophets about the Son of Man will be accomplished.


## Luke 18:32 (id: 942018032)

32For he will be given over to the Gentiles, and he will be mocked, and will be mistreated, and will be spit on.


## Luke 18:33 (id: 942018033)

33And having whipped {him}, they will kill {him}, and on the third day he will rise.”


## Luke 18:34 (id: 942018034)

34And they understood none of these things, and this word was hidden from them, and they did not understand the things being spoken.


## Luke 18:35 (id: 942018035)

35And it happened that, as he came near to Jericho, a certain blind man was sitting beside the road begging.


## Luke 18:36 (id: 942018036)

36And hearing a crowd going by, he was asking what this might be.


## Luke 18:37 (id: 942018037)

37And they reported to him, “Jesus the Nazarene is passing by.”


## Luke 18:38 (id: 942018038)

38And he cried out, saying, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me.”


## Luke 18:39 (id: 942018039)

39And the ones walking ahead were rebuking him so that he would be silent. But he was crying out much more, “Son of David, have mercy on me.”


## Luke 18:40 (id: 942018040)

40Then having stood still, Jesus commanded him to be brought to him. Then {when} he had come near, he asked him,


## Luke 18:41 (id: 942018041)

41“What do you desire {that} I might do for you?” So he said, “Lord, that I might see again.”


## Luke 18:42 (id: 942018042)

42And Jesus said to him, “See again. Your faith has saved you.”


## Luke 18:43 (id: 942018043)

43And immediately he saw again, and he was following him, glorifying God. And all the people, seeing this, gave praise to God.


## Luke 19:1 (id: 942019001)

1And he entered {and} was passing through Jericho.


## Luke 19:2 (id: 942019002)

2And behold a man, called Zacchaeus by name, and he was a chief tax collector, and he {was} rich.


## Luke 19:3 (id: 942019003)

3And he was trying to see Jesus, who he was, but he was not able from the crowd, because he was small in stature.


## Luke 19:4 (id: 942019004)

4And running on ahead, he climbed into a sycamore tree so that he might see him, because he was about to pass through that {way}.


## Luke 19:5 (id: 942019005)

5And when he came to the place, looking up, Jesus said to him, “Zacchaeus, hastening, come down, for it is necessary for me to stay in your house today.”


## Luke 19:6 (id: 942019006)

6And hastening, he came down and welcomed him, rejoicing.


## Luke 19:7 (id: 942019007)

7And having seen this, they all complained, saying, “He has gone in to lodge with a sinful man.”


## Luke 19:8 (id: 942019008)

8But having stood, Zacchaeus said to the Lord, “Behold, Lord, the half of my possessions I give to the poor, and if I have defrauded anything from anyone, I will restore four\-fold.”


## Luke 19:9 (id: 942019009)

9Then Jesus said to him, “Today salvation has come to this house, because he too is a son of Abraham.


## Luke 19:10 (id: 942019010)

10For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the one that has been lost.”


## Luke 19:11 (id: 942019011)

11And {as} they were listening to these things, he proceeded to speak a parable, because he was near Jerusalem and they thought that the kingdom of God was about to appear immediately.


## Luke 19:12 (id: 942019012)

12Therefore he said, “A certain well\-born man journeyed to a distant country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return.


## Luke 19:13 (id: 942019013)

13So calling ten of his servants, he gave them ten minas and said to them, ‘Conduct business in that I go.’


## Luke 19:14 (id: 942019014)

14But his citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him, saying, ‘We do not want this one to rule over us.’


## Luke 19:15 (id: 942019015)

15And it happened that, when he returned, having received the kingdom, he then commanded to be called to him those servants to whom he had given the silver, so that he might know what they had gained by doing business.


## Luke 19:16 (id: 942019016)

16Then the first came {and} said, ‘Master, your mina has earned ten minas.’


## Luke 19:17 (id: 942019017)

17And he said to him, ‘Well done, good servant! Because you were faithful in very little, be having authority over ten cities.’


## Luke 19:18 (id: 942019018)

18And the second came {and} said, ‘Your mina, master, has made five minas.’


## Luke 19:19 (id: 942019019)

19So he also said to this one, ‘And you be over five cities.’


## Luke 19:20 (id: 942019020)

20And the other one came saying, ‘Master, behold your mina, which I have been keeping put away in a cloth,


## Luke 19:21 (id: 942019021)

21for I feared you, because you are a harsh man. You take up what you did not put down, and you reap what you did not sow.’


## Luke 19:22 (id: 942019022)

22He says to him, ‘By your mouth I will judge you, wicked servant! Did you know that I am a harsh man, taking up what I did not put down, and reaping what I did not sow?


## Luke 19:23 (id: 942019023)

23And for what {reason} did you not put my silver in a bank, and I, having returned, would have collected it with interest?’


## Luke 19:24 (id: 942019024)

24And he said to the ones standing by, ‘Take the mina away from him and give it to the one having the ten minas.’


## Luke 19:25 (id: 942019025)

25And they said to him, ‘Master, he has ten minas.’


## Luke 19:26 (id: 942019026)

26‘I say to you that to everyone having, it will be given, but from the one not having, even what he has will be taken away.


## Luke 19:27 (id: 942019027)

27But these enemies of mine, the ones not having wanted me to reign over them, bring {them} here and kill them before me.’”


## Luke 19:28 (id: 942019028)

28And having said these things, he journeyed ahead, going up to Jerusalem.


## Luke 19:29 (id: 942019029)

29And it happened that, when he had come near to Bethphage and Bethany, to the mount called of Olives, he sent two of the disciples,


## Luke 19:30 (id: 942019030)

30saying, “Go into the village opposite, in which, entering, you will find a colt tied up, on which no one of men has ever sat. Having untied it, bring it here.


## Luke 19:31 (id: 942019031)

31And if anyone asks you, ‘Why are you untying it?’ thus you will say, ‘The Lord has need of it.’”


## Luke 19:32 (id: 942019032)

32So the ones that had been sent, going away, found {it} just as he had said to them.


## Luke 19:33 (id: 942019033)

33And {as} they were untying the colt, the owners of it said to them, “Why are you untying the colt?”


## Luke 19:34 (id: 942019034)

34So they said, “The Lord has need of it.”


## Luke 19:35 (id: 942019035)

35And they brought it to Jesus, and having thrown their cloaks upon the colt, they mounted Jesus on {it}.


## Luke 19:36 (id: 942019036)

36And {as} he was going along, they were spreading their cloaks on the road.


## Luke 19:37 (id: 942019037)

37And {as} he was already coming near to the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice {and} praise God with a loud voice concerning all of the mighty works that they had seen,


## Luke 19:38 (id: 942019038)

38saying, “Blessed is the king coming in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!”


## Luke 19:39 (id: 942019039)

39And some of the Pharisees from the crowd said to him, “Teacher, rebuke your disciples.”


## Luke 19:40 (id: 942019040)

40And answering, he said, “I say to you that if these were silent, the stones would cry out.”


## Luke 19:41 (id: 942019041)

41And as he approached, having seen the city, he wept over it,


## Luke 19:42 (id: 942019042)

42saying, “If you had known in this day, even you, the things toward peace! But now they have been hidden from your eyes.


## Luke 19:43 (id: 942019043)

43For days will come upon you, and your enemies will build a barricade around you, and they will surround you and press in on you from every side.


## Luke 19:44 (id: 942019044)

44And they will dash you to the ground and your children within you. And they will not leave stone upon stone in you because you did not know the time of your visitation.”


## Luke 19:45 (id: 942019045)

45And entering into the temple, he began to cast out the ones selling,


## Luke 19:46 (id: 942019046)

46saying to them, “It has been written, ‘My house {will be} a house of prayer,’ but you made it a ‘den of robbers.’”


## Luke 19:47 (id: 942019047)

47And he was teaching each day in the temple. And the chief priests and the scribes and the first of the people were seeking to destroy him,


## Luke 19:48 (id: 942019048)

48And they were not finding something that they might do, for all the people were hanging on him listening.


## Luke 20:1 (id: 942020001)

1And it happened that, on one of the days {when} he was teaching the people in the temple and proclaiming the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes approached with the elders.


## Luke 20:2 (id: 942020002)

2And they spoke, saying to him, “Tell us by what authority you do these things, or who the one is having given you this authority.”


## Luke 20:3 (id: 942020003)

3But answering, he said to them, “I also will ask you a word, and you tell me:


## Luke 20:4 (id: 942020004)

4The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men?”


## Luke 20:5 (id: 942020005)

5Then they reasoned with each other, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘For what {reason} did you not believe him?’


## Luke 20:6 (id: 942020006)

6But if we say, ‘From men,’ the whole people will stone us, for it is persuaded that John was a prophet.”


## Luke 20:7 (id: 942020007)

7And they answered that they did not know from where.


## Luke 20:8 (id: 942020008)

8And Jesus said to them, “Nor do I tell you by what authority I do these things.”


## Luke 20:9 (id: 942020009)

9Then he began to speak this parable to the people: “A man planted a vineyard and rented it out to farmers and went abroad for a long time.


## Luke 20:10 (id: 942020010)

10And at the time he sent a servant to the farmers so that they would give him from the fruit of the vineyard. But the farmers sent him away, having beaten {him}, empty.


## Luke 20:11 (id: 942020011)

11And he proceeded to send another servant, but they, beating {him} and treating {him} shamefully, sent that one also away empty.


## Luke 20:12 (id: 942020012)

12And he proceeded to send a third, but they, wounding {him}, cast this one also out.


## Luke 20:13 (id: 942020013)

13So the lord of the vineyard said, ‘What should I do? I will send my beloved son. Perhaps they will respect him.’


## Luke 20:14 (id: 942020014)

14But having seen him, the farmers were reasoning with each other, saying, ‘This is the heir. Let us kill him so that the inheritance may become ours.’


## Luke 20:15 (id: 942020015)

15And having thrown him out of the vineyard, they killed {him}. What then will the lord of the vineyard do to them?


## Luke 20:16 (id: 942020016)

16He will come and destroy these farmers and will give the vineyard to others.” But having heard this, they said, “May it not be!”


## Luke 20:17 (id: 942020017)

17But he, having looked at them, said, “What then is this that is written: ‘A stone that the builders rejected, this has become the head of the corner’?


## Luke 20:18 (id: 942020018)

18Everyone having fallen on that stone will be broken to pieces, but on whomever it falls, it will crush him.”


## Luke 20:19 (id: 942020019)

19And the scribes and the chief priests sought to lay hands on him in that hour, and they feared the people, for they knew that he spoke this parable against them.


## Luke 20:20 (id: 942020020)

20And having watched {him} carefully, they sent spies pretending themselves to be righteous, so that they might take hold of his word, in order to hand him over to the rule and to the authority of the governor.


## Luke 20:21 (id: 942020021)

21And they asked him, saying, “Teacher, we know that you speak and teach rightly, and you do not receive a face, but you teach the way of God in truth.


## Luke 20:22 (id: 942020022)

22Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar, or not?”


## Luke 20:23 (id: 942020023)

23But having perceived their craftiness, he said to them,


## Luke 20:24 (id: 942020024)

24“Show me a denarius. Whose image and inscription does it have?” And they said, “Caesar’s.”


## Luke 20:25 (id: 942020025)

25And he said to them, “Therefore give back the things of Caesar to Caesar, and the things of God to God.”


## Luke 20:26 (id: 942020026)

26And they were not able to take hold of his word in front of the people, and marveling at his answer, they became silent.


## Luke 20:27 (id: 942020027)

27Then some of the Sadducees, the ones saying there is no resurrection, having approached, questioned him,


## Luke 20:28 (id: 942020028)

28saying, “Teacher, Moses wrote for us, if someone’s brother dies, having a wife, and he is childless, that his brother should take his wife and raise up seed for his brother.


## Luke 20:29 (id: 942020029)

29Therefore, there were seven brothers, and the first, having taken a wife, died childless;


## Luke 20:30 (id: 942020030)

30and the second


## Luke 20:31 (id: 942020031)

31and the third took her; and likewise the seven also left no children, and died.


## Luke 20:32 (id: 942020032)

32Last, the woman also died.


## Luke 20:33 (id: 942020033)

33Therefore, in the resurrection, of which of them is she a wife? For the seven had her {as} wife.”


## Luke 20:34 (id: 942020034)

34And Jesus said to them, “The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage.


## Luke 20:35 (id: 942020035)

35But the ones having been considered worthy to obtain that age and the resurrection {that is} from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage.


## Luke 20:36 (id: 942020036)

36For neither are they able to die anymore, for they are {like} angels; and they are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.


## Luke 20:37 (id: 942020037)

37But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed at the bush, when he calls the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.


## Luke 20:38 (id: 942020038)

38And he is not a God of the dead, but of the living, for all are alive to him.”


## Luke 20:39 (id: 942020039)

39Then answering some of the scribes said, “Teacher, you have spoken well.”


## Luke 20:40 (id: 942020040)

40For they no longer dared to ask him anything.


## Luke 20:41 (id: 942020041)

41Then he said to them, “How do they say that the Christ is the son of David?


## Luke 20:42 (id: 942020042)

42For David himself says in the book of Psalms, ‘The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at my right hand,


## Luke 20:43 (id: 942020043)

43until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.”’


## Luke 20:44 (id: 942020044)

44David therefore calls him ‘Lord.’ And how is he his son?”


## Luke 20:45 (id: 942020045)

45And {while} all the people were listening, he said to his disciples,


## Luke 20:46 (id: 942020046)

46“Beware of the scribes, desiring to walk in long robes and loving greetings in the marketplaces and first seats in the synagogues and first places at the banquets.


## Luke 20:47 (id: 942020047)

47They devour the houses of widows, and for a pretext they pray at length. These will receive greater condemnation.”


## Luke 21:1 (id: 942021001)

1And having looked up, he saw the rich putting their gifts into the treasury.


## Luke 21:2 (id: 942021002)

2And he saw a certain poor widow putting two lepta there.


## Luke 21:3 (id: 942021003)

3And he said, “Truly I say to you, this poor widow put in more than all.


## Luke 21:4 (id: 942021004)

4For all these put in the gifts from the things abounding to them. But she, from her poverty, put in all the life that she had.”


## Luke 21:5 (id: 942021005)

5And {as} some were speaking about the temple, that it was decorated with beautiful stones and offerings, he said,


## Luke 21:6 (id: 942021006)

6“These things that you are looking at, days will come in which stone upon stone will not be left, which will not be torn down.”


## Luke 21:7 (id: 942021007)

7So they questioned him, saying, “Teacher, when therefore will these things be? And what {will be} the sign when these things are about to happen?”


## Luke 21:8 (id: 942021008)

8Then he said, “Be careful that you are not led astray. For many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am he,’ and, ‘The time has come near.’ Do not go after them.


## Luke 21:9 (id: 942021009)

9But when you hear of wars and rebellions, do not be terrified, for it is necessary for these things to happen first, but not immediately the end.”


## Luke 21:10 (id: 942021010)

10Then he said to them, “Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.


## Luke 21:11 (id: 942021011)

11There will be both great earthquakes, and famines and plagues in various places. There will be both terrifying events and great signs from heaven.


## Luke 21:12 (id: 942021012)

12But before all of these things, they will lay their hands on you and will persecute {you}, handing {you} over to the synagogues and prisons, bringing {you} before kings and governors for the sake of my name.


## Luke 21:13 (id: 942021013)

13It will turn out for you for a testimony.


## Luke 21:14 (id: 942021014)

14But put in your hearts not to prepare to be defended,


## Luke 21:15 (id: 942021015)

15for I will give to you a mouth and wisdom that all the ones opposing you will not be able to resist or contradict.


## Luke 21:16 (id: 942021016)

16But you will be handed over even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends, and they will put to death some of you.


## Luke 21:17 (id: 942021017)

17And you will be hated by all because of my name.


## Luke 21:18 (id: 942021018)

18And a hair of your head will not at all perish.


## Luke 21:19 (id: 942021019)

19By your endurance, you will gain your souls.


## Luke 21:20 (id: 942021020)

20But when you see Jerusalem being surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation is near.


## Luke 21:21 (id: 942021021)

21Then let the ones in Judea flee to the mountains, and let the ones in the midst of it leave, and let the ones in the fields not enter into it.


## Luke 21:22 (id: 942021022)

22For these are days of vengeance, to fulfill all the things that have been written.


## Luke 21:23 (id: 942021023)

23But woe to the ones having in the womb and to the ones nursing in those days! For there will be great distress upon the land and wrath to this people.


## Luke 21:24 (id: 942021024)

24And they will fall by the mouth of the sword, and they will be led captive into all the nations, and Jerusalem will be trampled by the nations until the times of the nations are fulfilled.


## Luke 21:25 (id: 942021025)

25And there will be signs in the sun and moon and stars, and distress of nations on the earth in perplexity at the roaring and tossing of the sea.


## Luke 21:26 (id: 942021026)

26Men will be fainting from fear and expectation of the things coming upon the inhabited world, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.


## Luke 21:27 (id: 942021027)

27And then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and much glory.


## Luke 21:28 (id: 942021028)

28But {when} these things begin to happen, stand up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is coming near.”


## Luke 21:29 (id: 942021029)

29And he spoke a parable to them: “Look at the fig tree and all the trees.


## Luke 21:30 (id: 942021030)

30When they already sprout, seeing for yourselves you know that the summer is already near.


## Luke 21:31 (id: 942021031)

31Thus also you, when you see these things happening, know that the kingdom of God is near.


## Luke 21:32 (id: 942021032)

32Truly I say to you that this generation will certainly not pass away until they all happen.


## Luke 21:33 (id: 942021033)

33The heaven and the earth will pass away, but my words will certainly not pass away.


## Luke 21:34 (id: 942021034)

34But pay attention to yourselves, so that your hearts may not be burdened with hangover and drunkenness, and everyday worries, and that sudden day may come upon you


## Luke 21:35 (id: 942021035)

35like a trap, for it will come upon all the ones sitting on the face of the whole earth.


## Luke 21:36 (id: 942021036)

36But stay awake in every time, praying, so that you may be strong enough to escape all these things that are about to happen, and to stand before the Son of Man.”


## Luke 21:37 (id: 942021037)

37And during the days, he was teaching in the temple, but during the nights, he went out {and} lodged on the hill that is called Olivet.


## Luke 21:38 (id: 942021038)

38And all the people were getting up early to him to hear him in the temple.


## Luke 22:1 (id: 942022001)

1And the Festival of Unleavened Bread, which is called the Passover, was coming near.


## Luke 22:2 (id: 942022002)

2And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how they might kill him, for they were fearing the people.


## Luke 22:3 (id: 942022003)

3Then Satan entered into Judas, the one called Iscariot, being from the number of the Twelve.


## Luke 22:4 (id: 942022004)

4And having gone away, he spoke with the chief priests and captains {about} how he might hand him over to them.


## Luke 22:5 (id: 942022005)

5And they rejoiced, and they agreed to give him silver.


## Luke 22:6 (id: 942022006)

6And he agreed and was seeking an opportunity to hand him over to them away from the crowd.


## Luke 22:7 (id: 942022007)

7Then came the Day of Unleavened Bread, on which it was necessary to sacrifice the Passover.


## Luke 22:8 (id: 942022008)

8And he sent Peter and John, saying, “Going, prepare for us the Passover, so that we may eat {it}.”


## Luke 22:9 (id: 942022009)

9And they said to him, “Where do you wish that we should prepare {it}?”


## Luke 22:10 (id: 942022010)

10And he answered them, “Behold, {when} you have entered into the city, a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him into the house into which he enters.


## Luke 22:11 (id: 942022011)

11And say to the master of the house, ‘The Teacher says to you, “Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?”’


## Luke 22:12 (id: 942022012)

12And that one will show you a large upper room, furnished. Prepare {it} there.”


## Luke 22:13 (id: 942022013)

13And having gone away, they found {it} just as he had said to them, and they prepared the Passover.


## Luke 22:14 (id: 942022014)

14And when it was the hour, he reclined to eat, and the apostles with him.


## Luke 22:15 (id: 942022015)

15And he said to them, “With desire I have desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.


## Luke 22:16 (id: 942022016)

16For I say to you that I will certainly not eat it until when it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.”


## Luke 22:17 (id: 942022017)

17And having taken a cup {and} having given thanks, he said, “Take this, and divide {it} among yourselves.


## Luke 22:18 (id: 942022018)

18For I say to you, from now on I will certainly not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God comes.”


## Luke 22:19 (id: 942022019)

19And having taken bread, having given thanks, he broke {it} and gave {it} to them, saying, “This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in my remembrance.”


## Luke 22:20 (id: 942022020)

20And the cup in the same way after the supper, saying, “This cup {is} the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.


## Luke 22:21 (id: 942022021)

21But behold, the hand of the one handing me over {is} with me on the table.


## Luke 22:22 (id: 942022022)

22For the Son of Man indeed goes according to {what} has been determined. But woe to that man through whom he is handed over!”


## Luke 22:23 (id: 942022023)

23And they began to discuss among themselves {about} which of them therefore might be the one going to do this.


## Luke 22:24 (id: 942022024)

24Then a quarrel also happened among them {about} which of them seems to be greater.


## Luke 22:25 (id: 942022025)

25But he said to them, “The kings of the nations lord it over them, and the ones having authority over them are called Benefactors.


## Luke 22:26 (id: 942022026)

26But you {be} not thus. Instead, let the greater among you become like the younger. and the one leading like the one serving.


## Luke 22:27 (id: 942022027)

27For who {is} greater, the one reclining to eat or the one serving? {Is it} not the one reclining to eat? But I am in the midst of you as one serving.


## Luke 22:28 (id: 942022028)

28But you are the ones having continued with me in my trials.


## Luke 22:29 (id: 942022029)

29And I grant to you, just as my Father has granted to me, a kingdom,


## Luke 22:30 (id: 942022030)

30so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel.


## Luke 22:31 (id: 942022031)

31Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has asked to sift you like wheat.


## Luke 22:32 (id: 942022032)

32But I have asked concerning you that your faith may not fail. And you, when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.”


## Luke 22:33 (id: 942022033)

33But he said to him, “Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death.”


## Luke 22:34 (id: 942022034)

34But he said, “I say to you, Peter, the rooster will not crow today before you deny three times that you know me.”


## Luke 22:35 (id: 942022035)

35And he said to them, “When I sent you out without a money bag and sack and sandals, you did not lack anything, did you?” And they said, “Nothing.”


## Luke 22:36 (id: 942022036)

36Then he said to them, “But now, the one having a money bag, let him take {it}, and likewise a sack. And the one not having a sword, let him sell his cloak and buy one.


## Luke 22:37 (id: 942022037)

37For I say to you, this that is written must be accomplished in me, ‘And he was reckoned with the lawless.’ For indeed the thing concerning me has an accomplishment.”


## Luke 22:38 (id: 942022038)

38Then they said, “Lord, behold! Here are two swords.” And he said to them, “It is enough.”


## Luke 22:39 (id: 942022039)

39And having gone out, he went according to his custom to the Mount of Olives, and the disciples also followed him.


## Luke 22:40 (id: 942022040)

40And having come to the place, he said to them, “Pray not to enter into temptation.”


## Luke 22:41 (id: 942022041)

41And he went away from them about the throw of a stone, and having put down his knees, he was praying,


## Luke 22:42 (id: 942022042)

42saying, “Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me. Yet, let not my will, but yours, happen.”


## Luke 22:43 (id: 942022043)

43\[And an angel from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him.


## Luke 22:44 (id: 942022044)

44And being in agony, he was praying more earnestly, and his sweat became like drops of blood falling on the ground.]


## Luke 22:45 (id: 942022045)

45And having risen up from the prayer, having come to the disciples, he found them sleeping from the sorrow.


## Luke 22:46 (id: 942022046)

46And he said to them, “Why are you sleeping? Having risen up, pray so that you do not enter into temptation.”


## Luke 22:47 (id: 942022047)

47He still speaking, behold a crowd, and the one called Judas, one of the Twelve, was leading them. And he came near to Jesus to kiss him.


## Luke 22:48 (id: 942022048)

48But Jesus said to him, “Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?”


## Luke 22:49 (id: 942022049)

49And the ones around him, having seen {what} was going to happen, said, “Lord, if we will strike with a sword?”


## Luke 22:50 (id: 942022050)

50And a certain one of them struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear.


## Luke 22:51 (id: 942022051)

51But answering, Jesus said, “Allow up to this!” And touching his ear, he healed him.


## Luke 22:52 (id: 942022052)

52Then Jesus said to the ones having come out against him—chief priests and captains of the temple and elders—“As against a robber have you come out with swords and clubs?


## Luke 22:53 (id: 942022053)

53I being with you each day in the temple, you did not lay hands on me. But this is your hour, and the authority of the darkness.”


## Luke 22:54 (id: 942022054)

54Now having seized him, they led {him} away and brought {him} into the house of the high priest. But Peter was following from a distance.


## Luke 22:55 (id: 942022055)

55And they having kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and having sat down together, Peter was sitting in the midst of them.


## Luke 22:56 (id: 942022056)

56Then a certain servant girl, having seen him sitting towards the light and looking steadily at him, said, “This one also was with him.”


## Luke 22:57 (id: 942022057)

57But he denied {it}, saying, “Woman, I do not know him.”


## Luke 22:58 (id: 942022058)

58And after a little while another, having seen him, said, “You also are from them.” But Peter said, “Man, I am not.”


## Luke 22:59 (id: 942022059)

59And about one hour having passed, a certain other one was insisting, saying, “In truth, this one was also with him, for he is also a Galilean.”


## Luke 22:60 (id: 942022060)

60But Peter said, “Man, I do not know what you are saying.” And immediately, {while} he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.


## Luke 22:61 (id: 942022061)

61And turning, the Lord looked at Peter, and Peter remembered the word of the Lord, that he said to him, “Before a rooster crows today you will deny me three times.”


## Luke 22:62 (id: 942022062)

62And going outside, he wept bitterly.


## Luke 22:63 (id: 942022063)

63And the men holding him were mocking {and} beating him.


## Luke 22:64 (id: 942022064)

64And having blindfolded {him}, they were questioning him, saying, “Prophesy! Who is the one having hit you?”


## Luke 22:65 (id: 942022065)

65And they were saying many other things to him, blaspheming {him}.


## Luke 22:66 (id: 942022066)

66And when it became day, the elders of the people gathered together, both chief priests and scribes, and they led him into their Sanhedrin,


## Luke 22:67 (id: 942022067)

67saying, “If you are the Christ, tell us.” But he said to them, “If I told you, you would certainly not believe;


## Luke 22:68 (id: 942022068)

68and if I questioned you, you would certainly not answer.


## Luke 22:69 (id: 942022069)

69But from now, the Son of Man will be sitting at the right hand of the power of God.”


## Luke 22:70 (id: 942022070)

70Then they all said, “Therefore are you the Son of God?” And he said to them, “You are saying that I am.”


## Luke 22:71 (id: 942022071)

71And they said, “Why do we still have need of testimony? For we ourselves have heard from his own mouth.”


## Luke 23:1 (id: 942023001)

1And the whole multitude of them, rising up, led him to Pilate.


## Luke 23:2 (id: 942023002)

2And they began to accuse him, saying, “We found this one perverting our nation and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar and saying that he himself is Christ, a king.”


## Luke 23:3 (id: 942023003)

3But Pilate questioned him, saying, “Are you the King of the Jews?” But he, answering him, said, “You say {it}.”


## Luke 23:4 (id: 942023004)

4Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, “I find no cause in this man.”


## Luke 23:5 (id: 942023005)

5But they were insisting, saying, “He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, indeed, beginning from Galilee as far as here.”


## Luke 23:6 (id: 942023006)

6And Pilate, having heard this, asked whether the man was a Galilean.


## Luke 23:7 (id: 942023007)

7And having learned that he was under the authority of Herod, he sent him to Herod, being also in Jerusalem himself in those days.


## Luke 23:8 (id: 942023008)

8And Herod, having seen Jesus, rejoiced greatly, for he had been desiring to see him for a long time, because he had heard about him, and he was hoping to see some sign happen by him.


## Luke 23:9 (id: 942023009)

9Then he questioned him in many words, but he answered him nothing.


## Luke 23:10 (id: 942023010)

10And the chief priests and the scribes stood by, vehemently accusing him.


## Luke 23:11 (id: 942023011)

11Then Herod, with his soldiers, also despised him and mocked {him}. Having put elegant clothing around {him}, he sent him back to Pilate.


## Luke 23:12 (id: 942023012)

12Then both Herod and Pilate became friends with each other on that day, for they were previously being in hostility between themselves.


## Luke 23:13 (id: 942023013)

13Then Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,


## Luke 23:14 (id: 942023014)

14{and} said to them, “You brought this man to me as turning the people away, and behold, I, having examined him before you, found nothing in this man as cause for what you are accusing against him.


## Luke 23:15 (id: 942023015)

15But neither did Herod, for he sent him back to us, and behold, nothing that is worthy of death has been done by him.


## Luke 23:16 (id: 942023016)

16Therefore, having punished him, I will release him.”


## Luke 23:17 (id: 942023017)

17\[But he had obligation to release to them one {prisoner} at every feast.]


## Luke 23:18 (id: 942023018)

18But they cried out all together, saying, “Take away this one, but release to us Barabbas!”


## Luke 23:19 (id: 942023019)

19(He had been put in prison for a certain rebellion that happened in the city, and for murder.)


## Luke 23:20 (id: 942023020)

20Then Pilate again addressed them, desiring to release Jesus.


## Luke 23:21 (id: 942023021)

21But they were shouting, saying, “Crucify, crucify him.”


## Luke 23:22 (id: 942023022)

22Then he spoke to them a third time, “For what evil did this one do? No cause for death have I found in him. Therefore, having punished him, I will release him.”


## Luke 23:23 (id: 942023023)

23But they were insisting with loud voices, demanding for him to be crucified, and their voices prevailed.


## Luke 23:24 (id: 942023024)

24And Pilate decreed for their demand to happen.


## Luke 23:25 (id: 942023025)

25Then he released the one that had been put in prison for rebellion and murder, whom they were requesting, but he handed over Jesus to their will.


## Luke 23:26 (id: 942023026)

26And as they led him away, seizing Simon, a certain Cyrenean coming from the country, they put the cross on him, to carry behind Jesus.


## Luke 23:27 (id: 942023027)

27And a great crowd of the people was following him, and of women mourning and wailing for him.


## Luke 23:28 (id: 942023028)

28But turning to them, Jesus said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.


## Luke 23:29 (id: 942023029)

29For behold, days are coming in which they will say, ‘Blessed {are} the barren, yes, the wombs that did not give birth and breasts that did not nurse.’


## Luke 23:30 (id: 942023030)

30Then they will begin to say to the mountains, ‘Fall on us,’ and to the hills, ‘Cover us.’


## Luke 23:31 (id: 942023031)

31For if they do these things in the moist tree, what will happen in the dry?”


## Luke 23:32 (id: 942023032)

32And others, two criminals, were also being led away with him to be put to death.


## Luke 23:33 (id: 942023033)

33And when they came to the place that is called The Skull, there they crucified him, and the criminals—one at the right and one at the left.


## Luke 23:34 (id: 942023034)

34\[But Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.”] But, dividing up his robes, they cast a lot.


## Luke 23:35 (id: 942023035)

35And the people stood by watching, and the rulers were also ridiculing him, saying, “He saved others; let him save himself, if he is the Christ of God, the Chosen One.”


## Luke 23:36 (id: 942023036)

36Then the soldiers also mocked him, coming up {and} offering him vinegar,


## Luke 23:37 (id: 942023037)

37and saying, “If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself.”


## Luke 23:38 (id: 942023038)

38And there was also an inscription over him, “This {is} the King of the Jews.”


## Luke 23:39 (id: 942023039)

39Then one of the criminals having been hung blasphemed him, saying, “Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and us.”


## Luke 23:40 (id: 942023040)

40But answering, the other, rebuking him, said, “Do you not even fear God, since you are under the same judgment?


## Luke 23:41 (id: 942023041)

41And we justly, for indeed we are receiving worthy of what we did, but this one did nothing wrong.”


## Luke 23:42 (id: 942023042)

42And he said, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.”


## Luke 23:43 (id: 942023043)

43And he said to him, “Truly I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise.”


## Luke 23:44 (id: 942023044)

44And it was already about the sixth hour, and darkness happened over the whole land until the ninth hour.


## Luke 23:45 (id: 942023045)

45The sun failed, and the curtain of the temple was split in the middle.


## Luke 23:46 (id: 942023046)

46And crying out with a loud voice, Jesus said, “Father, into your hands I entrust my spirit.” And having said this, he expired.


## Luke 23:47 (id: 942023047)

47Now the centurion, having seen the thing having happened, was glorifying God, saying, “Truly this man was righteous.”


## Luke 23:48 (id: 942023048)

48And all the crowds that had come together for this spectacle, having seen the things having happened, returned, beating their breasts.


## Luke 23:49 (id: 942023049)

49But all the ones acquainted with him, and the women following him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.


## Luke 23:50 (id: 942023050)

50And behold, a man, Joseph by name, being a council member, a good and righteous man,


## Luke 23:51 (id: 942023051)

51(this one had not agreed with the council and their action) from Arimathea, a city of the Jews, who was waiting for the kingdom of God.


## Luke 23:52 (id: 942023052)

52This one, having approached Pilate, asked for the body of Jesus.


## Luke 23:53 (id: 942023053)

53And having taken {it} down, he wrapped it in a linen cloth and put him in a hewn tomb where no one ever had lain.


## Luke 23:54 (id: 942023054)

54And it was the Day of Preparation, and the Sabbath was dawning.


## Luke 23:55 (id: 942023055)

55And the women who had come out of Galilee with him, having followed after, saw the tomb and how his body was put.


## Luke 23:56 (id: 942023056)

56Then, having returned, they prepared spices and ointments. And on the Sabbath they rested, according to the commandment.


## Luke 24:1 (id: 942024001)

1Now on the first of the week, deeply at dawn, they came to the tomb, bringing spices that they had prepared.


## Luke 24:2 (id: 942024002)

2And they found the stone having been rolled away from the tomb,


## Luke 24:3 (id: 942024003)

3but having entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.


## Luke 24:4 (id: 942024004)

4And it happened that, while they were perplexed about this, and behold, two men in flashing clothing stood by them.


## Luke 24:5 (id: 942024005)

5And as they became terrified and bowed their faces toward the ground, they said to them, “Why are you seeking the living among the dead?


## Luke 24:6 (id: 942024006)

6He is not here, but he was raised up! Remember how he spoke to you, still being in Galilee,


## Luke 24:7 (id: 942024007)

7saying that it was necessary for the Son of Man to be handed over into the hands of sinful men and to be crucified, and on the third day to rise up.”


## Luke 24:8 (id: 942024008)

8And they remembered his words,


## Luke 24:9 (id: 942024009)

9and having returned from the tomb, they reported all these things to the Eleven and to all the rest.


## Luke 24:10 (id: 942024010)

10And they were Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the {mother} of James, and the other {women} with them, telling these things to the apostles.


## Luke 24:11 (id: 942024011)

11And these words seemed before them like nonsense, and they disbelieved them.


## Luke 24:12 (id: 942024012)

12But Peter, having risen up, ran to the tomb, and having stooped down, he sees only the linen cloths. So he went away to his {home}, wondering {what} had happened.


## Luke 24:13 (id: 942024013)

13And behold, on that same day, two of them were going to a distant village that {was named} Emmaus, 60 stadia from Jerusalem,


## Luke 24:14 (id: 942024014)

14and they were talking to each other about all these things that had happened.


## Luke 24:15 (id: 942024015)

15And it happened, while they talked and discussed, that Jesus himself, approaching, was going with them.


## Luke 24:16 (id: 942024016)

16But their eyes were being held so as not to recognize him.


## Luke 24:17 (id: 942024017)

17Then he said to them, “What {are} these words that you are exchanging with each other as you are walking?” And they stood still, gloomy.


## Luke 24:18 (id: 942024018)

18Then, answering, one named Cleopas said to him, “Are you alone visiting Jerusalem and have not known the things having happened in her in these days?”


## Luke 24:19 (id: 942024019)

19And he said to them, “What kind?” And they said to him, “The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene, who was a man, a prophet powerful in work and word in front of God and all the people,


## Luke 24:20 (id: 942024020)

20and how the chief priests and our rulers handed him over to a judgment of death and crucified him.


## Luke 24:21 (id: 942024021)

21But we were hoping that he was the one going to redeem Israel. But indeed also with all these things, he is spending this third day since these things happened.


## Luke 24:22 (id: 942024022)

22But indeed, some women among us astonished us, having been at the tomb early


## Luke 24:23 (id: 942024023)

23and not finding his body, they came saying they had also seen a vision of angels, saying he was alive.


## Luke 24:24 (id: 942024024)

24And some of the ones with us went to the tomb and they found thus, just as the women had indeed said, but they did not see him.”


## Luke 24:25 (id: 942024025)

25And he said to them, “O foolish ones and slow in heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!


## Luke 24:26 (id: 942024026)

26Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things, and to enter into his glory?”


## Luke 24:27 (id: 942024027)

27And beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, he explained to them the things concerning himself in all the Scriptures.


## Luke 24:28 (id: 942024028)

28And they drew near to the village where they were going, and he acted as if he would travel further.


## Luke 24:29 (id: 942024029)

29And they urged him, saying, “Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day has already declined.” And he went in to stay with them.


## Luke 24:30 (id: 942024030)

30And it happened that, when he had reclined to eat with them, taking the bread, he blessed {it}, and having broken {it}, he was giving {it} to them.


## Luke 24:31 (id: 942024031)

31Then their eyes were opened, and they recognized him, and he became invisible from them.


## Luke 24:32 (id: 942024032)

32And they said to one another, “Was not our heart burning as he spoke to us on the way, as he opened to us the Scriptures?”


## Luke 24:33 (id: 942024033)

33And having risen up that same hour, they returned to Jerusalem. And they found the Eleven having been gathered, and the ones with them,


## Luke 24:34 (id: 942024034)

34saying, “Truly the Lord has been raised, and he has been seen by Simon!”


## Luke 24:35 (id: 942024035)

35And they related the things on the way, and how he was made known to them in the breaking of the bread.


## Luke 24:36 (id: 942024036)

36And as they were saying these things, he himself stood in the midst of them and said to them, “Peace to you.”


## Luke 24:37 (id: 942024037)

37But having been frightened and becoming terrified, they thought they were seeing a spirit.


## Luke 24:38 (id: 942024038)

38And he said to them, “Why have you been troubled, and why are doubts arising in your heart?


## Luke 24:39 (id: 942024039)

39See my hands and my feet, that I myself am. Touch me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see me having.”


## Luke 24:40 (id: 942024040)

40And having said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.


## Luke 24:41 (id: 942024041)

41And as they were still disbelieving and wondering from the joy, he said to them, “Do you have something eatable here?”


## Luke 24:42 (id: 942024042)

42So they gave him a piece of a broiled fish,


## Luke 24:43 (id: 942024043)

43and taking {it}, he ate {it} before them.


## Luke 24:44 (id: 942024044)

44Then he said to them, “These {are} my words that I spoke to you {when} I was still with you, that all the things having been written about me in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the Psalms, must be fulfilled.”


## Luke 24:45 (id: 942024045)

45Then he opened their mind to understand the Scriptures, and he said to them,


## Luke 24:46 (id: 942024046)

46“Thus it has been written: The Christ would suffer, and rise up from the dead on the third day,


## Luke 24:47 (id: 942024047)

47and repentance for forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in his name to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.


## Luke 24:48 (id: 942024048)

48You are witnesses of these things.


## Luke 24:49 (id: 942024049)

49And I am sending upon you the promise of my Father. But you stay in the city until you put on power from heaven.”


## Luke 24:50 (id: 942024050)

50Then he led them out as far as towards Bethany, and lifting up his hands, he blessed them.


## Luke 24:51 (id: 942024051)

51And it happened that, while he was blessing them, he separated from them and was carried up into heaven.


## Luke 24:52 (id: 942024052)

52And they, having worshiped him, returned to Jerusalem with great joy,


## Luke 24:53 (id: 942024053)

53and they were through all in the temple, blessing God.
