## Ezra 1:1 (id: 915001001)

1Now in year one of Cyrus, the king of Persia, in order to accomplish the word of Yahweh from the mouth of Jeremiah, Yahweh stirred up the spirit of Cyrus, the king of Persia. So he caused a sound to pass throughout all his kingdom, and also in writing, saying:


## Ezra 1:2 (id: 915001002)

2“Thus says Cyrus, the king of Persia: Yahweh, the God of heaven, has given to me all the kingdoms of the earth, and he himself has appointed me to build for him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.


## Ezra 1:3 (id: 915001003)

3Whoever among you is from all his people, may his God be with him, and may he go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and may he build the house of Yahweh, the God of Israel. He is the God who is in Jerusalem.


## Ezra 1:4 (id: 915001004)

4And every one who is remaining in all of the places where he is sojourning there, let the men of his place lift him with silver and with gold, and with goods and with livestock, along with the freewill offering for the house of God, which is in Jerusalem.”


## Ezra 1:5 (id: 915001005)

## Ezra 3:1 (id: 915003001)

1Then the seventh month came and the sons of Israel were in their cities. And the people were gathered together as one man to Jerusalem.


## Ezra 3:2 (id: 915003002)

2Then arose Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brothers the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brothers, and they built the altar of the God of Israel to offer up burnt up offerings on it as is written in the law of Moses, the man of God.


## Ezra 3:3 (id: 915003003)

3And they set up the altar on its foundation, for dread was on them because of the peoples of the lands. Then they offered up on it burnt up offerings to Yahweh, burnt up offerings at the morning and at the evening.


## Ezra 3:4 (id: 915003004)

4Then they performed the Festival of Huts as is written, with a burnt up offering day by day, by number according to the ordinance of the matter of the day, on its day.


## Ezra 3:5 (id: 915003005)

5And after this was a continual burnt up offering, and for the new moons, and for all the consecrated appointed times of Yahweh, and for everyone who freely offered a freewill offering to Yahweh.


## Ezra 3:6 (id: 915003006)

6From day one of the seventh month they began to offer up burnt up offerings to Yahweh, but the temple of Yahweh had not been founded.


## Ezra 3:7 (id: 915003007)

7And they gave silver to the masons and to the carpenters, and food, and drink, and oil to the Sidonians and to the Tyrians, to bring trees of cedar from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the permission of Cyrus, the king of Persia, given to them.


## Ezra 3:8 (id: 915003008)

8Then in the second year of their coming to the house of God in Jerusalem, in the second month, Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the rest of their brothers the priests and the Levites, and all the ones who came from captivity to Jerusalem began, and they appointed the Levites from a son of 20 years and above to act as overseers for the work of the house of Yahweh.


## Ezra 3:9 (id: 915003009)

9And Jeshua, his sons and his brothers, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, stood as one to act as overseers for the ones doing the work at the house of God, the sons of Henadad, their sons, and their brothers the Levites.


## Ezra 3:10 (id: 915003010)

10Then the ones who were building laid the foundation of the temple of Yahweh. And they caused to stand the clothed priests with the trumpets, and the Levites, the sons of Asaph, with the cymbals, to praise Yahweh in accordance with the hands of David, the king of Israel.


## Ezra 3:11 (id: 915003011)

11Then they sang in response, praising and giving thanks to Yahweh: “For he is good, for his covenant faithfulness to Israel is to eternity!” And all the people shouted a great shout in praise to Yahweh because the foundation of the house of Yahweh had been laid.


## Ezra 3:12 (id: 915003012)

12But many from the priests and the Levites, and the heads of the fathers, the old men who had seen the first house, at the founding of this house in their eyes, were weeping with a loud voice. Yet many with a shout, with joy, were lifting up a voice.


## Ezra 3:13 (id: 915003013)

13So the people could not differentiate the sound of the shout of joy from the sound of the weeping of the people. For the people were shouting a great shout, and the sound was heard as far as from a remote place.


## Ezra 4:1 (id: 915004001)

1Now the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the sons of the exile were building a temple for Yahweh, the God of Israel.


## Ezra 4:2 (id: 915004002)

2So they came to Zerubbabel and to the heads of the fathers and they said to them, “Let us build with you, for, like you, we seek your God and to him we have been sacrificing since the days of Esarhaddon, the king of Assyria, the one who caused us to come up here.”


## Ezra 4:3 (id: 915004003)

3But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the heads of the fathers of Israel said to them, “It is not for you and for us to build a house for our God, but we ourselves together will build for Yahweh, the God of Israel, just as the king Cyrus, the king of Persia, has commanded us.”


## Ezra 4:4 (id: 915004004)

4And it happened that the people of the land were making the hands of the people of Judah weak, and making them afraid to build,


## Ezra 4:5 (id: 915004005)

5and hiring counselors against them to frustrate their plans all the days of Cyrus, the king of Persia, and until the reign of Darius, the king of Persia.


## Ezra 4:6 (id: 915004006)

6Now in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, they wrote an accusation against those who dwelled in Judah and Jerusalem.


## Ezra 4:7 (id: 915004007)

7And in the days of Artaxerxes, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel and the rest of his companions wrote to Artaxerxes, the king of Persia, and the script of the letter was written in Aramaic and was interpreted in Aramaic.


## Ezra 4:8 (id: 915004008)

8Rehum, a lord of decree, and Shimshai the scribe wrote one letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king as follows:


## Ezra 4:9 (id: 915004009)

9Then Rehum, a lord of decree, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions, the judges and the rulers, the officials, the Persians, the Erechites, the Babylonians, the Susaites (that is, the Elamites),


## Ezra 4:10 (id: 915004010)

10and the rest of the nations whom Ashurbanipal the great and the noble caused to be exiled and caused them to dwell in the cities of Samaria, and the rest of Beyond\-the\-River. And now:


## Ezra 4:11 (id: 915004011)

11(This is a copy of the letter that they sent to him.) “To Artaxerxes the king; your servants, men of Beyond\-the\-River; and now:


## Ezra 4:12 (id: 915004012)

12let it be known to the king that the Jews who went up from near you have come to us at Jerusalem. Rebuilding the rebellious and evil city, they are completing the walls and repairing the foundations.


## Ezra 4:13 (id: 915004013)

13Now let it be known to the king that if that city is built and the walls are completed, they will not give tax, tribute, or custom, and the revenue of the kings will suffer harm.


## Ezra 4:14 (id: 915004014)

14Now, because we have eaten the salt of the palace, and it is not appropriate for us to see the nakedness of the king, on account of this we have sent and made known to the king,


## Ezra 4:15 (id: 915004015)

15so that he may search in the book of the records of your fathers. And you will discover in the book of the records and learn that that city is a rebellious city and one that has caused harm to kings and provinces, and they have made revolt in its midst since the ancient days. On account of this, that city was destroyed.


## Ezra 4:16 (id: 915004016)

16We are making known to the king that if that city is built and the walls are completed, because of this there will be no share for you in Beyond\-the\-River.”


## Ezra 4:17 (id: 915004017)

17The king sent the answer: “To Rehum, a lord of decree, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions who dwell in Samaria, and the rest of Beyond the River: Peace. And now:


## Ezra 4:18 (id: 915004018)

18The letter that you sent to us has been carefully read aloud before me.


## Ezra 4:19 (id: 915004019)

19So from me was set a decree, and they searched and discovered that that city since the ancient days has risen up against kings and rebellion and revolt have been made in it.


## Ezra 4:20 (id: 915004020)

20And mighty kings were over Jerusalem, even rulers over all of Beyond the River; and tax, tribute, and custom were paid to them.


## Ezra 4:21 (id: 915004021)

21Now, set a decree to stop these men, so that city may not be rebuilt until the decree is set from me.


## Ezra 4:22 (id: 915004022)

22And be careful of negligence of action concerning this. Why should the damage increase to the harm of the kings?”


## Ezra 4:23 (id: 915004023)

23Then from when the copy of the letter of Artaxerxes the king was read aloud before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went in a hurry to Jerusalem against the Jews, and they stopped them by an arm and strength.


## Ezra 4:24 (id: 915004024)

24At that time the work of the house of God which is in Jerusalem stopped, and it was stopped until the second year of the reign of Darius, the king of Persia.


## Ezra 5:1 (id: 915005001)

1Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet and Zechariah, the son of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah and in Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel who was over them.


## Ezra 5:2 (id: 915005002)

2Then Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, arose and began to build the house of God which is in Jerusalem, and the prophets of God were with them, supporting them.


## Ezra 5:3 (id: 915005003)

3At that time, Tattenai, the governor of Beyond\-the\-River, and Shethar\-Bozenai, and their companions came to them and spoke to them thus, “Who set for you a decree to build this house and to complete this structure?”


## Ezra 5:4 (id: 915005004)

4Then accordingly we said to them, “What are the names of the men who are building this building?”


## Ezra 5:5 (id: 915005005)

5But the eye of God was on the elders of the Jews, and they did not stop them until the report came to Darius and then they returned the letter concerning this matter.


## Ezra 5:6 (id: 915005006)

6A copy of the letter that Tattenai, the governor of Beyond\-the\-River, and Shethar\-Bozenai and his companions, the officials who were in Beyond\-the\-River, sent to Darius the king.


## Ezra 5:7 (id: 915005007)

7They sent a report to him and thus was written within it: “To Darius the king: All peace.


## Ezra 5:8 (id: 915005008)

8Let it be known to the king that we went to Judah, the province, to the house of the great God, and it is being built of large stones, and timber is being placed in the walls. And this work is being done diligently and is succeeding in their hand.


## Ezra 5:9 (id: 915005009)

9Then we asked these elders, we said thus to them, ‘Who set a decree for you to build this house and to complete this structure?’


## Ezra 5:10 (id: 915005010)

10And also we asked of them their names, to let you know, so that we could write down the names of the men who were at their head.


## Ezra 5:11 (id: 915005011)

11And thus is the answer they returned us, saying, ‘We are servants of him who is the God of heaven and earth, and we are building the house that was built many years before this, and a great king of Israel built it and completed it.


## Ezra 5:12 (id: 915005012)

12However, because of this, that our fathers caused the God of heaven to be angry, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, the Chaldean, and he destroyed this house and caused the people to be exiled to Babylon.


## Ezra 5:13 (id: 915005013)

13But in year one of Cyrus, the king of Babylon, Cyrus the king set a decree to build this house of God.


## Ezra 5:14 (id: 915005014)

14And also the vessels of the house of God, of gold and silver, that Nebuchadnezzar had taken out from the temple that was in Jerusalem and had brought them to the temple of Babylon—Cyrus the king took them out from the temple of Babylon and they were given to one whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had set as governor.


## Ezra 5:15 (id: 915005015)

15Then he said to him, “Take away these vessels. Go deposit them in the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be built on its place.”


## Ezra 5:16 (id: 915005016)

16Then that Sheshbazzar came; he laid the foundation of the house of God which is in Jerusalem. And from then even until now it is being built, but it is not complete.’


## Ezra 5:17 (id: 915005017)

17And now, if it is good to the king, let a search be made in the house of the treasures of the king which is there in Babylon, if it is that a decree was set by Cyrus the king to build this house of God in Jerusalem. And let him send to us the will of the king concerning this.”


## Ezra 6:1 (id: 915006001)

1Then Darius the king set a decree and they searched in the house of the books where the treasures had been deposited there in Babylon.


## Ezra 6:2 (id: 915006002)

2And one scroll was found in the fortress at Ecbatana that is in the province of Media, and the record was written within it thusly:


## Ezra 6:3 (id: 915006003)

3“In year one of Cyrus the king, Cyrus the king set a decree about the house of God in Jerusalem: ‘Let the house be built, a place where sacrifices are sacrificed, and let its foundations be raised. Its height will be 60 cubits. Its width will be 60 cubits,


## Ezra 6:4 (id: 915006004)

4with three layers of large stone and a layer of new timber. And let the cost be given from the house of the king.


## Ezra 6:5 (id: 915006005)

5And also, the vessels of the house of God, of gold and silver, that Nebuchadnezzar had taken out from the temple that was in Jerusalem and had brought to Babylon, must be returned. And let each go to the temple that is in Jerusalem, to its place. So you must put them in the house of God.’”


## Ezra 6:6 (id: 915006006)

6“Now Tattenai, the governor of Beyond\-the\-River, Shethar\-Bozenai, and their companions, the officials who are in Beyond\-the\-River: be far away from there.


## Ezra 6:7 (id: 915006007)

7Leave alone the work of that house of God. Let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build that house of God on its place.


## Ezra 6:8 (id: 915006008)

8And from me is set a decree for what it is that you shall do with these elders of the Jews to build that house of God. And from the treasures of the king (that is, the tribute of Beyond\-the\-River) let the expense be given to those men diligently, so that it does not stop.


## Ezra 6:9 (id: 915006009)

9And whatever is needed (whether sons of bulls, or rams, or lambs for burnt up offerings to the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, or oil, according to the command of the priests who are in Jerusalem), let it be given to them day by day (that is, without neglect),


## Ezra 6:10 (id: 915006010)

10so that they may be offering sweet\-smelling sacrifices to the God of heaven and praying for the life of the king and his sons.


## Ezra 6:11 (id: 915006011)

11And from me is set a decree that, for any man who changes this edict, a beam shall be pulled from his house, and, being erect, he shall be impaled on it. And his house shall be made a rubbish heap on account of this.


## Ezra 6:12 (id: 915006012)

12And may the God who has caused his name to dwell there overthrow any king or people who stretches out his hand to change, to destroy that house of God which is in Jerusalem. I, Darius, have set a decree. Let it be done diligently.”


## Ezra 6:13 (id: 915006013)

13Then Tattenai, the governor of Beyond\-the\-River, Shethar\-Bozenai, and their companions did thus diligently, according to what Darius the king had sent.


## Ezra 6:14 (id: 915006014)

14And the elders of the Jews were building and prospering by the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they built and completed by the decree of the God of Israel and by the decree of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes, the king of Persia.


## Ezra 6:15 (id: 915006015)

15And this house was done by day three of the month of Adar, which was year six of the reign of Darius the king.


## Ezra 6:16 (id: 915006016)

16And the sons of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the rest of the sons of the exile performed the dedication of this house of God with joy.


## Ezra 6:17 (id: 915006017)

17And they offered for the dedication of this house of God 100 bulls, 200 rams, 400 lambs, and 12 bucks of goats for a sin offering for all Israel, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.


## Ezra 6:18 (id: 915006018)

18And they caused the priests to stand in their divisions, and the Levites in their sections, for the service of the God who is in Jerusalem, according to the writing of the book of Moses.


## Ezra 6:19 (id: 915006019)

19So the sons of the exile performed the Passover on day 14 of the first month.


## Ezra 6:20 (id: 915006020)

20For the priests and the Levites had purified themselves as one, all of them were pure. And they slaughtered the Passover for all the sons of the exile, and for their brothers, the priests, and for themselves.


## Ezra 6:21 (id: 915006021)

21And the sons of Israel ate, the ones who had returned from the exile and every one who separated himself to them from the uncleanness of the nations of the land in order to seek Yahweh, the God of Israel.


## Ezra 6:22 (id: 915006022)

22Then they performed the Festival of Unleavened Bread seven days with joy, because Yahweh had caused them to be joyful, and had caused the heart of the king of Assyria to turn toward them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel.


## Ezra 7:1 (id: 915007001)

1Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes, the king of Persia: Ezra (the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah,


## Ezra 7:2 (id: 915007002)

2the son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub,


## Ezra 7:3 (id: 915007003)

3the son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth,


## Ezra 7:4 (id: 915007004)

4the son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki,


## Ezra 7:5 (id: 915007005)

5the son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the head priest),


## Ezra 7:6 (id: 915007006)

6this Ezra went up from Babylon, and he was a skilled scribe in the law of Moses that Yahweh, the God of Israel, had given. And the king granted to him all his request according to the hand of Yahweh his God upon him.


## Ezra 7:7 (id: 915007007)

7And some from the sons of Israel and from the priests, and the Levites, and the ones who sang, and the gatekeepers, and the temple servants went up to Jerusalem in year seven of Artaxerxes the king.


## Ezra 7:8 (id: 915007008)

8And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king.


## Ezra 7:9 (id: 915007009)

9For on the first of the first month was the beginning of the ascent from Babylon. And on the first of the fifth month he came to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him.


## Ezra 7:10 (id: 915007010)

10For Ezra had made his heart firm to seek the law of Yahweh, and to do it, and to teach statute and ordinance in Israel.


## Ezra 7:11 (id: 915007011)

11Now this is a copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest, the scribe, a scribe of the words of the commandments of Yahweh and his statutes for Israel:


## Ezra 7:12 (id: 915007012)

12“Artaxerxes, the king of kings, to Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven: Peace. And now:


## Ezra 7:13 (id: 915007013)

13from me is set a decree that everyone in my kingdom who freely offers to go to Jerusalem with you, from the people ‘Israel’ and its priests and the Levites, may go.


## Ezra 7:14 (id: 915007014)

14Because it was sent from before the king and his seven counselors to inquire about Judah and about Jerusalem by the law of your God which is in your hand,


## Ezra 7:15 (id: 915007015)

15and to bring silver and gold that the king and his counselors have freely offered to the God of Israel whose dwelling is in Jerusalem,


## Ezra 7:16 (id: 915007016)

16with all the silver and the gold that you find in all the province of Babylon, along with the freewill offering of the people and the priests who freely give for the house of God, which is in Jerusalem:


## Ezra 7:17 (id: 915007017)

17therefore, diligently you shall buy with this money bulls, rams, lambs, and their grain offerings and their drink offerings; and you shall offer them on the altar of the house of your God, which is in Jerusalem.


## Ezra 7:18 (id: 915007018)

18And you may do whatever seems good to you and to your brothers to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, according to the will of your God.


## Ezra 7:19 (id: 915007019)

19And the vessels that were given to you for the service of the house of your God, deliver in full before the God of Jerusalem.


## Ezra 7:20 (id: 915007020)

20And the rest of what is needed for the house of your God that falls to you to give, you may give from the house of the treasures of the king.


## Ezra 7:21 (id: 915007021)

21And from me myself, Artaxerxes the king, is set a decree for all the treasurers who are in Beyond\-the\-River: that all that Ezra (the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven) may ask of you, let it be done diligently;


## Ezra 7:22 (id: 915007022)

22as much as 100 silver kikkars, and as much as 100 cors of wheat, and as much as 100 baths of wine, and as much as 100 baths of oil, and salt which is not written.


## Ezra 7:23 (id: 915007023)

23Everything that is from the decree of the God of heaven shall be done exactly for the house of the God of heaven. For why should there be wrath against the kingdom of the king and his sons?


## Ezra 7:24 (id: 915007024)

24And to you is made known that there is no authority to set tax, tribute, or custom upon all the priests, and the Levites, the singers, the gatekeepers, the temple servants, and the servants of that house of God.


## Ezra 7:25 (id: 915007025)

25And as for you, Ezra, according to the wisdom of your God that is in your hand, appoint magistrates and judges who may judge all the people who are in Beyond\-the\-River, all who know the laws of your God. And you shall teach those who do not know.


## Ezra 7:26 (id: 915007026)

26And everyone who will not do the law of your God and the law of the king, judgment shall be exacted from him diligently, whether for death, whether for banishment, whether for confiscation of goods, or for imprisonment.”


## Ezra 7:27 (id: 915007027)

27Blessed be Yahweh, the God of our fathers, who gave according to this in the heart of the king, to glorify the house of Yahweh, which is in Jerusalem,


## Ezra 7:28 (id: 915007028)

28and caused covenant faithfulness to extend to me before the face of the king, and his counselors, and before all the mighty officials of the king. And as for me, I gained strength according to the hand of Yahweh my God upon me, and I gathered from Israel heads to go up with me.


## Ezra 8:1 (id: 915008001)

1Now these are the heads of their fathers and their enrollment by genealogy, the ones who went up with me from Babylon in the reign of Artaxerxes the king:


## Ezra 8:2 (id: 915008002)

2From the sons of Phinehas: Gershom. From the sons of Ithamar: Daniel. From the sons of David: Hattush,


## Ezra 8:3 (id: 915008003)

3from the sons of Shecaniah. From the sons of Parosh: Zechariah, and with him were 150 males enrolled by genealogy.


## Ezra 8:4 (id: 915008004)

4From the sons of Pahath\-Moab: Eliehoenai, the son of Zerahiah, and with him were 200 males.


## Ezra 8:5 (id: 915008005)

5From the sons of … Shecaniah the son of Jahaziel, and with him were 300 males.


## Ezra 8:6 (id: 915008006)

6And from the sons of Adin: Ebed, the son of Jonathan, and with him were 50 males.


## Ezra 8:7 (id: 915008007)

7And from the sons of Elam: Jeshaiah, the son of Athaliah, and with him were 70 males.


## Ezra 8:8 (id: 915008008)

8And from the sons of Shephatiah: Zebadiah, the son of Michael, and with him were 80 males.


## Ezra 8:9 (id: 915008009)

9From the sons of Joab: Obadiah, the son of Jehiel, and with him were 218 males.


## Ezra 8:10 (id: 915008010)

10And from the sons of … Shelomith, the son of Josiphiah, and with him were 160 males.


## Ezra 8:11 (id: 915008011)

11And from the sons of Bebai: Zechariah, the son of Bebai, and with him were 28 males.


## Ezra 8:12 (id: 915008012)

12And from the sons of Azgad: Johanan, the son of Hakkatan, and with him were 110 males.


## Ezra 8:13 (id: 915008013)

13And from the last sons of Adonikam, and these were their names: Eliphelet, Jeuel, and Shemaiah, and with them were 60 males.


## Ezra 8:14 (id: 915008014)

14And from the sons of Bigvai: Uthai and Zaccur, and with him were 70 males.


## Ezra 8:15 (id: 915008015)

15And I gathered them to the river, the one that goes to Ahava, and we encamped there three days. And I examined the people and the priests, but I did not find there any from the sons of Levi.


## Ezra 8:16 (id: 915008016)

16Then I sent for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, the heads; and for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, men of understanding.


## Ezra 8:17 (id: 915008017)

17And I commanded them to go to Iddo, the head at the place Kasiphia. And I put in their mouth words to speak to Iddo and his brothers, the temple servants in the place Kasiphia, to bring to us those who minister for the house of our God.


## Ezra 8:18 (id: 915008018)

18And according to the good hand of our God upon us, they brought to us: a man of insight from the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel, even Sherebiah, and his sons and his brothers were 18;


## Ezra 8:19 (id: 915008019)

19and Hashabiah, and with him, Jeshaiah, from the sons of Merari, whose brothers and their sons were 20;


## Ezra 8:20 (id: 915008020)

20and 220 temple servants from the temple servants whom David with the officials had given for the service of the Levites. All of them were designated by names.


## Ezra 8:21 (id: 915008021)

21Then I proclaimed a fast there at the river Ahava, to afflict ourselves before the face of our God to seek from him a straight way for us, and for our children, and for all our property.


## Ezra 8:22 (id: 915008022)

22For I was ashamed to ask from the king an army and horsemen to help us from an enemy on the way. For we had spoken to the king, saying, “The hand of our God is for good upon all those who seek him, but his might and his nose are against all those who forsake him.”


## Ezra 8:23 (id: 915008023)

23So we fasted and sought from our God concerning this, and he was entreated by us.


## Ezra 8:24 (id: 915008024)

24Then I separated 12 from the leaders of the priests to Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and with them ten from their brothers.


## Ezra 8:25 (id: 915008025)

25And I weighed out to them the silver and the gold and the vessels, the offering of the house of our God that the king, and his counselors, and his officials, and all Israel (the ones who were found) had offered.


## Ezra 8:26 (id: 915008026)

26And I weighed out to their hand 650 kikkars of silver, and vessels of silver of 100 kikkars, 100 kikkars of gold,


## Ezra 8:27 (id: 915008027)

27and 20 bowls of gold of 1000 darics, and two good, gleaming vessels of bronze, precious as gold.


## Ezra 8:28 (id: 915008028)

28And I said to them, “You are holy to Yahweh, and the vessels are holy. And the silver and the gold are a freewill offering to Yahweh, the God of your fathers.


## Ezra 8:29 (id: 915008029)

29Watch and keep until you weigh them out before the face of the leaders of the priests and the Levites and the leaders of the fathers of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of Yahweh.”


## Ezra 8:30 (id: 915008030)

30So the priests and the Levites received the weight of the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem, to the house of our God.


## Ezra 8:31 (id: 915008031)

31Then we set out from the river Ahava on day 12 of the first month to go to Jerusalem. And the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the palm of the enemy and ambush on the way.


## Ezra 8:32 (id: 915008032)

32So we came to Jerusalem, and we stayed there three days.


## Ezra 8:33 (id: 915008033)

33And on the fourth day, the silver and the gold and the vessels were weighed out: in the house of our God into the hand of Meremoth, the son of Uriah, the priest, and with him was Eleazar, the son of Phinehas (and with them were Jozabad, the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah, the son of Binnui, the Levites);


## Ezra 8:34 (id: 915008034)

34by number and weight of everything. And all the weight was written at that time.


## Ezra 8:35 (id: 915008035)

35The ones who had come from the captivity, the sons of the exile, offered burnt up offerings to the God of Israel: 12 bulls for all Israel, 96 rams, 77 lambs, 12 male goats of a sin offering. The whole was a burnt up offering to Yahweh.


## Ezra 8:36 (id: 915008036)

36And they gave the laws of the king to the satraps of the king and the governors of Beyond\-the\-River. And they lifted the people and the house of God.


## Ezra 9:1 (id: 915009001)

1Now as soon as these things were finished, the leaders came to me, saying, “The people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands according to their abominations, of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Jebusite, the Ammonite, the Moabite, the Egyptian, and the Amorite.


## Ezra 9:2 (id: 915009002)

2For they have lifted from their daughters for themselves and for their sons, so they have mixed the seed of holiness with the peoples of the lands. And the hand of the leaders and the rulers has been first in this unfaithfulness.”


## Ezra 9:3 (id: 915009003)

3And as soon as I heard this matter, I tore my garment and my robe. And I pulled out some from the hair of my head and my beard, and I sat down appalled.


## Ezra 9:4 (id: 915009004)

4And all who trembled at the words of the God of Israel on account of the unfaithfulness of the exiles were gathered to me. And I was sitting appalled until the offering of the evening.


## Ezra 9:5 (id: 915009005)

5And at the offering of the evening I arose from my humilation, and when I tore my garment and my robe. And I knelt down on my knees, and spread out my palms to Yahweh my God.


## Ezra 9:6 (id: 915009006)

6And I said, “My God, I am ashamed and humiliated to raise my face to you, my God. For our iniquities have multiplied to above the head, and our guilt has grown up as far as to the heavens.


## Ezra 9:7 (id: 915009007)

7From the days of our fathers until this day we are in great guilt. And in our iniquities, we ourselves, our kings, and our priests have been given into the hand of the kings of the lands by sword, by captivity, and by plunder, and by shame of face, as this day.


## Ezra 9:8 (id: 915009008)

8But now, according to a little moment, favor has come from with Yahweh our God to leave for us survivors and to give to us a peg in his holy place, for our God to brighten our eyes and to give us a little reviving in our slavery.


## Ezra 9:9 (id: 915009009)

9For we are slaves, yet our God has not forsaken us in our slavery. But he has extended to us covenant faithfulness before the face of the kings of Persia to give to us reviving, to raise up the house of our God and to cause its ruins to stand, and to give to us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.


## Ezra 9:10 (id: 915009010)

10So now, our God, what can we say after this? For we have forsaken your commandments,


## Ezra 9:11 (id: 915009011)

11which you commanded by the hand of your servants, the prophets, saying, ‘The land that you are entering to possess is a land of impurity by the impurity of the peoples of the lands, by their abominations that have filled it from mouth to mouth with their uncleanness.


## Ezra 9:12 (id: 915009012)

12So now, neither give your daughters to their sons nor lift their daughters for your sons, nor shall you seek their peace or their good until eternity, so that you may be strong and eat the good things of the land and cause your sons to inherit it until eternity.’


## Ezra 9:13 (id: 915009013)

13Yet after all that has come upon us because of our evil deeds and because of our great guilt (although you, our God, you have restrained it to lower than our iniquities, and you have given to us a survival such as this),


## Ezra 9:14 (id: 915009014)

14should we return to breaking your commandments and to intermarrying with the peoples of these abominations? Would you not be angry with us as far as completion, so that there is neither remnant nor survivors?


## Ezra 9:15 (id: 915009015)

15Yahweh, the God of Israel, you are righteous, for we are left as survivors, as this day. Behold us, before your face in our guilt, for there is none to stand before your face on account of this.”


## Ezra 10:1 (id: 915010001)

1And when Ezra prayed, and when he confessed, weeping and casting himself down before the face of the house of God, an extremely great assembly from Israel, men and women and children, gathered to him. Indeed the people wept an abundant weeping.


## Ezra 10:2 (id: 915010002)

2Then Shekaniah, the son of Jehiel, from the sons of Elam, answered and said to Ezra, “We ourselves have acted unfaithfully against our God and have caused foreign women from the peoples of the land to dwell. But now, there is hope for Israel concerning this.


## Ezra 10:3 (id: 915010003)

3So now, let us cut a covenant with our God to cause all the women to go out, and the ones who were born from them, by the counsel of my lord and the ones who tremble at the commandment of our God. And let it be done according to the law.


## Ezra 10:4 (id: 915010004)

4Arise, for the matter is on you, and we are with you. Be strong and do.”


## Ezra 10:5 (id: 915010005)

5And Ezra arose and caused the leaders of the priests, the Levites, and all Israel to swear an oath to do according to this word. So they swore an oath.


## Ezra 10:6 (id: 915010006)

6And Ezra rose up from before the face of the house of God, and he went to the chamber of Jehohanan, the son of Eliashib. And he went there. He did not eat bread and he did not drink water, but was mourning on account of the unfaithfulness of the exiles.


## Ezra 10:7 (id: 915010007)

7And they caused a sound to pass throughout Judah and Jerusalem for all the sons of the exile to gather to Jerusalem.


## Ezra 10:8 (id: 915010008)

8And for all who did not come in three days according to the counsel of the leaders and the elders, all his property would be devoted to the ban. And he himself would be separated from the assembly of the exiles.


## Ezra 10:9 (id: 915010009)

9So all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered to Jerusalem in three days. It was the ninth month, on 20 in the month. And all the people sat in the open place of the house of God, trembling on account of the matter and because of the rains.


## Ezra 10:10 (id: 915010010)

10And Ezra the priest rose up and said to them, “You yourselves have acted unfaithfully and have caused foreign wives to dwell, to add to the guilt of Israel.


## Ezra 10:11 (id: 915010011)

11But now, give praise to Yahweh, the God of your fathers, and do his will, and separate yourselves from the peoples of the land, and from the foreign women.”


## Ezra 10:12 (id: 915010012)

12Then all the assembly answered and said in a loud voice, “Thus, according to your word, it is on us to do.


## Ezra 10:13 (id: 915010013)

13However, the people are many, and the time is rain showers and there is no strength to stand in the outdoors. And the work is neither for one day nor for two, for we have done much to rebel in this matter.


## Ezra 10:14 (id: 915010014)

14Let our leaders stand for all the assembly. And let all who are in our cities, the ones who have caused foreign women to dwell, come at appointed times, and with them the elders of city by city and its magistrates, until the burning of the nose of our God is turned back from us as far as it concerns this matter.”


## Ezra 10:15 (id: 915010015)

15Only Jonathan, the son of Asahel, and Jahzeiah, the son of Tikvah, stood against this. And Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite supported them.


## Ezra 10:16 (id: 915010016)

16So the sons of the exile did thus, and men (the heads of the fathers by the house of their fathers, and all of them by names) were separated to Ezra the priest. And they sat down on day one of the tenth month to seek out the matter.


## Ezra 10:17 (id: 915010017)

17And they finished with all the men, the ones who had caused foreign women to dwell, by day one of the first month.


## Ezra 10:18 (id: 915010018)

18And some were found from the sons of the priests who had caused foreign women to dwell: from the sons of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and his brothers: Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah.


## Ezra 10:19 (id: 915010019)
