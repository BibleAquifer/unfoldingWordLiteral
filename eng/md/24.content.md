11And the word of Yahweh was to me, saying, “What do you see, Jeremiah?” And {I} said, “I see an almond branch.”

12And Yahweh said to me, “You have done well to see, for I am watching over my word to do it.”


## Jeremiah 1:13 (id: 924001013)

13And the word of Yahweh was to me a second {time}, saying, “What do you see?” And {I} said, “I see a blown\-on pot and its face {is away} from the face of the north.”


## Jeremiah 1:14 (id: 924001014)

14And Yahweh said to me, “From the north disaster will be released on all the inhabitants of the land.


## Jeremiah 1:15 (id: 924001015)

15For behold, I am calling to all the clans of the kingdoms of the north”—the declaration of Yahweh. “And they will come, and {each} man will set his throne {at} the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem and against all its surrounding walls and against all the cities of Judah.


## Jeremiah 1:16 (id: 924001016)

16And I shall speak my judgment {against} them according to all their evil in which they abandoned me and burned incense to other gods, and worshipped what they made with their own hands.


## Jeremiah 1:17 (id: 924001017)

17So you yourself shall gird your loins, and stand up and say to them all that I myself shall command you! Do not be dismayed from before their faces lest I dismay you before their faces!


## Jeremiah 1:18 (id: 924001018)

## Jeremiah 2:1 (id: 924002001)

1And the word of Yahweh was to me, saying,


## Jeremiah 2:2 (id: 924002002)

3Israel {was} holy to Yahweh, the first of his harvest! All those who ate it became guilty; disaster came upon them —the declaration of Yahweh.’”

4Hear the word of Yahweh, house of Jacob, and all clans of the house of Israel.


## Jeremiah 2:5 (id: 924002005)

5Thus says Yahweh, “What did your fathers find wrong with me, that they went far away from upon me, and they went after the empty, and became empty?


## Jeremiah 2:6 (id: 924002006)

6And they did not say, ‘Where {is} Yahweh, who led us up from the land of Egypt? The one who led us in the wilderness, in a land of a desert and a pit, in a land of dryness and thick darkness, in a land—no human passes through it and no man lives there?’


## Jeremiah 2:7 (id: 924002007)

7And I brought you to the land of Carmel, to eat its fruit and its good things! But you came and defiled my land, and you made my inheritance into an abomination!


## Jeremiah 2:8 (id: 924002008)

8The priests did not say, ‘Where {is} Yahweh?’ and the handlers of the law did not know me, and the shepherds transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal and went after things not profitable.


## Jeremiah 2:9 (id: 924002009)

9Therefore still I shall make a case with you —the declaration of Yahweh— and with the sons of your sons I shall make a case .


## Jeremiah 2:10 (id: 924002010)

10For cross over {to} the coasts of Kittim and look, and {to} Kedar send out and pay very close attention and see if there has been {a thing} as this!


## Jeremiah 2:11 (id: 924002011)

11Has a nation exchanged gods, though they {were} not gods? But my people has exchanged its glory for {what} does not profit.


## Jeremiah 2:12 (id: 924002012)

12Be appalled, heavens, because of this, and shudder, be very desolate! —the declaration of Yahweh.


## Jeremiah 2:13 (id: 924002013)

13For my people have done two evils {to} me: They have abandoned the spring of living waters to dig out cisterns for themselves, broken cisterns that do not hold the water.


## Jeremiah 2:14 (id: 924002014)

14{Is} Israel a slave? Or was he born {in} a household? So why has he become for plunder?


## Jeremiah 2:15 (id: 924002015)

15Young lions roared against him; they gave their voice. And they made his land into a desolation; his cities became ruins without an inhabitant.


## Jeremiah 2:16 (id: 924002016)

16Also, the people of Memphis and Tahpanhes have shaved your skull.


## Jeremiah 2:17 (id: 924002017)

17Did you not do this to yourself {when} you abandoned Yahweh your God, in the time he led you on the way?


## Jeremiah 2:18 (id: 924002018)

18And now, why—to you, to the road of Egypt to drink the waters of Shihor? And why—to you, to the road of Assyria to drink the waters of a river?


## Jeremiah 2:19 (id: 924002019)

19Your evil will rebuke you, and your apostasy will punish you. So think and understand that {it is} wicked and bitter {when} you forsake Yahweh your God, and you have no fear of me. —the declaration of Lord Yahweh of hosts.


## Jeremiah 2:20 (id: 924002020)

20For from long ago I broke your yoke; I tore to pieces your fetters. But you said, ‘I will not serve!’ For on every high hill and beneath every leafy tree, you yourself lie down, prostitute.


## Jeremiah 2:21 (id: 924002021)

21And I myself planted you {as} a choice vine, all of it of genuine seed. And how have you changed towards me {into} degenerates of the strange vine?


## Jeremiah 2:22 (id: 924002022)

22For even if you clean yourself with natron or multiply for yourself lye, your iniquity is a stain before my face —the declaration of Lord Yahweh.


## Jeremiah 2:23 (id: 924002023)

23How can you say, ‘I am not defiled; I have not walked after the Baals’? See your path in the valleys! Know what you have done —a swift female camel entangling her ways,


## Jeremiah 2:24 (id: 924002024)

24a wild donkey, a pupil of the wilderness, in the desire of its spirit gasping {for} air! {In} her heat, who can turn her away? All of the ones seeking her will not tire; in her month they will find her.


## Jeremiah 2:25 (id: 924002025)

25Restrain your foot from {becoming} bare and your throat from thirst! But you have said, ‘{It is} hopeless! No, for I love strangers and after them I shall go!’


## Jeremiah 2:26 (id: 924002026)

26Like the shame of a thief when he is found, so the house of Israel will be ashamed— they, their kings, their princes, and their priests and prophets,


## Jeremiah 2:27 (id: 924002027)

27the ones who say to the tree, ‘You {are} my father,’ and to the stone, ‘You gave birth to me.’ For they face the nape to me and not faces. But in the time of their misfortune they say, ‘Arise and save us!’


## Jeremiah 2:28 (id: 924002028)

28But where {are} the gods that you made for yourself? Let them arise if they would save you in the time of your misfortune, for the number of your cities, equal your gods, Judah!


## Jeremiah 2:29 (id: 924002029)

29Why do you complain to me? All of you have rebelled against me —the declaration of Yahweh.


## Jeremiah 2:30 (id: 924002030)

30For futility I have struck your sons. They would not accept discipline. Your sword has devoured your prophets like a destructive lion!


## Jeremiah 2:31 (id: 924002031)

31You {are} the generation! Know the word of Yahweh! Have I been a wilderness to Israel? Or a land of thick darkness? Why would my people say, ‘We shall roam free, we shall not go to you anymore’?


## Jeremiah 2:32 (id: 924002032)

32Will a virgin forget her jewelry, a bride her sashes? Yet my people have forgotten me days without number!


## Jeremiah 2:33 (id: 924002033)

33How well you make your way to seek love, so even {to} the wicked women you taught your ways.


## Jeremiah 2:34 (id: 924002034)

34Also on your skirts has been found the blood of the innocent, needy lives. They were not discovered in burglary. But despite all these,


## Jeremiah 2:35 (id: 924002035)

35you also say, ‘But I am innocent; surely his nose has turned away from me.’ Behold, I shall judge you because you say, ‘I have not sinned.’


## Jeremiah 2:36 (id: 924002036)

36Why do you treat very lightly to change your ways? You will also be shamed from Egypt, just as you were shamed from Assyria.


## Jeremiah 2:37 (id: 924002037)

37You will also go out from this {place}, and your hands {will be} on your head, for Yahweh has rejected the ones you trusted, and you will not be successful by them.”


## Jeremiah 3:1 (id: 924003001)

1Saying, “If a man sends away his wife and she goes from him and becomes another man’s, will he return to her again? Would that land not be greatly polluted? And you have been a prostitute {with} many lovers and would {you} return to me? —the declaration of Yahweh.


## Jeremiah 3:2 (id: 924003002)

2Lift up your eyes to the barren heights and see! Where have you not been ravished? By the roads you sat for them, as an Arab in the wilderness. And you have polluted the land with your prostitution and with your evil.


## Jeremiah 3:3 (id: 924003003)

3So the showers have been withheld and the late rains have not been; yet you have the forehead of a prostitute woman; you refuse to be embarrassed.


## Jeremiah 3:4 (id: 924003004)

4Have you not from now called to me: ‘My father! You {are} a close friend of my youth!


## Jeremiah 3:5 (id: 924003005)

5Will he guard forever? Or will he keep watch to eternity?’ Behold, you have spoken, but you do the evils as you can!”


## Jeremiah 3:6 (id: 924003006)

6Then Yahweh said to me in the days of Josiah the king, “Do you see what apostate Israel has done? She herself has walked up every high hill and to underneath every leafy tree, and she has been a prostitute there.


## Jeremiah 3:7 (id: 924003007)

7And {I} said, ‘After her doing all these, she will return to me,’ but she did not return. Then her treacherous sister Judah saw.


## Jeremiah 3:8 (id: 924003008)

8So I saw that because of all circumstances where apostate Israel had committed adultery, I had sent her away and had given a scroll of her divorce to her. But her sister Judah, acting treacherously, did not fear, and she went out, and she herself also prostituted.


## Jeremiah 3:9 (id: 924003009)

9And her prostitution was from thoughtlessness. And she defiled the land, and committed adultery {with} the stone and the tree.


## Jeremiah 3:10 (id: 924003010)

10And even in all of this, her treacherous sister Judah has not returned to me with all her heart, but with a lie—the declaration of Yahweh.”


## Jeremiah 3:11 (id: 924003011)

11Then Yahweh said to me, “Apostate Israel has shown her spirit to be righteous more than Judah acting treacherously!


## Jeremiah 3:12 (id: 924003012)

12Go and proclaim these words to the north and say, ‘Return, apostate Israel!—the declaration of Yahweh— I shall not cause my face to fall against you. Since I {am} faithful—the declaration of Yahweh— I shall not keep forever.


## Jeremiah 3:13 (id: 924003013)

13Only, know your iniquity, for you have transgressed against Yahweh your God, and you have spread your ways to strangers under every leafy tree, and to my voice you did not listen —the declaration of Yahweh.


## Jeremiah 3:14 (id: 924003014)

14Turn back, apostatizing sons!—the declaration of Yahweh—for I myself am your husband, and I shall take you, one from a city and two from a clan, and I shall bring you {to} Zion!


## Jeremiah 3:15 (id: 924003015)

15Then I shall give you shepherds according to my heart, and they will shepherd you {with} knowledge and insight.


## Jeremiah 3:16 (id: 924003016)

16And it will happen that you will increase and be fruitful in the land in those days—the declaration of Yahweh—they will no longer say, “The Box of the Covenant of Yahweh!” And it will not come up in heart, and they will not remember it. And they will not miss {it}, and another will not be made.’


## Jeremiah 3:17 (id: 924003017)

17In that time they will call to Jerusalem, ‘the throne of Yahweh,’ and all the nations will gather to her—to the name of Yahweh, to Jerusalem. And they will no longer walk after the stubbornness of their evil heart.


## Jeremiah 3:18 (id: 924003018)

18In those days, the house of Judah will walk with the house of Israel. And they will come together from the land of the north to the land that I caused your fathers to inherit.


## Jeremiah 3:19 (id: 924003019)

19And I myself said, ‘How I would set you among sons and give to you a pleasant land, an inheritance of beautiful splendor of nations!’ And {I} said, ‘You shall call me “my father”.’ and from after me you shall not turn away.


## Jeremiah 3:20 (id: 924003020)

20But, {like} a woman dealing treacherously with her companion, thus you have dealt treacherously against me, house of Israel —the declaration of Yahweh.”


## Jeremiah 3:21 (id: 924003021)

21A voice is heard on the bare heights, weeping pleas of the sons of Israel! For they have made their ways crooked; they have forgotten Yahweh their God.


## Jeremiah 3:22 (id: 924003022)

22“Turn back, apostatizing sons! I will heal your apostasies!” “Behold! We come to you, for you {are} Yahweh our God!


## Jeremiah 3:23 (id: 924003023)

23But the lie {is} from the hills, a commotion of mountains; but with Yahweh our God {is} the salvation of Israel.


## Jeremiah 3:24 (id: 924003024)

24Yet from our youth the shame has consumed the toil of our fathers— their flock and their cattle, their sons and their daughters!


## Jeremiah 3:25 (id: 924003025)

25Let us lie down in our shame, and let our humiliation cover us, for against Yahweh our God we have sinned! Ourselves and our fathers, from our youth and to this day, and we have not listened to the voice of Yahweh our God!”


## Jeremiah 4:1 (id: 924004001)

1“If you return, Israel—the declaration of Yahweh— to me you should return. And if you remove your detestable things from before my face and do not wander,


## Jeremiah 4:2 (id: 924004002)

2and you swear, ‘{As} Yahweh {is} alive’ in truth, in justice, and in righteousness, then the nations will bless themselves in him, and in him they will boast.”


## Jeremiah 4:3 (id: 924004003)

3For thus says Yahweh to the man of Judah and to Jerusalem: ‘Plow your unplowed ground, and do not sow into thorns.


## Jeremiah 4:4 (id: 924004004)

4Be circumcised to Yahweh, and remove the foreskins of your heart, man of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem, lest my heat go out like the fire, and burn, and there is no one to extinguish from the face of the evil of your deeds.


## Jeremiah 4:5 (id: 924004005)

5Declare in Judah, and in Jerusalem announce, and say, “Blow the horn in the land!” Call out fully and say, “Be gathered, and let us go to the cities of fortification.”


## Jeremiah 4:6 (id: 924004006)

6Lift up a banner toward Zion, and bring yourself to safety, do not stand still! For I am bringing disaster from the north and a great collapse.


## Jeremiah 4:7 (id: 924004007)

7A lion has come up from his thicket and a destroyer of nations has set out. He has gone out from his place to make your land into a desolation; your cities will become ruins, without an inhabitant.


## Jeremiah 4:8 (id: 924004008)

8Because of this, gird yourselves {with} sackcloth, lament and wail! For the force of the nose of Yahweh has not turned away from us.


## Jeremiah 4:9 (id: 924004009)

9And it will happen in that day—the declaration of Yahweh— the heart of the king and the heart of the officials will perish, And the priests will be appalled, and the prophets will be horrified.’”


## Jeremiah 4:10 (id: 924004010)

10And I said, “Alas! Lord Yahweh, surely you have completely deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, ‘It will be well for you.’ Yet the sword will reach as far as the life.”


## Jeremiah 4:11 (id: 924004011)

11In that time it will be said of this people and of Jerusalem, “A shimmering wind of the bare hills of the wilderness—the way of the daughter of my people, not to winnow and not to cleanse,


## Jeremiah 4:12 (id: 924004012)

12a wind more full than these will come to me. Now I myself shall also speak judgments {against} them.


## Jeremiah 4:13 (id: 924004013)

13Behold, like clouds he comes up, and his chariots {are} like the storm. His horses are faster than eagles. Woe to us, for we are devastated!


## Jeremiah 4:14 (id: 924004014)

14Cleanse your heart from evil, Jerusalem so that you might be saved. Until when will your unjust intentions lodge within you?


## Jeremiah 4:15 (id: 924004015)

15For a voice declares from Dan, and announces coming disaster from the mount of Ephraim.


## Jeremiah 4:16 (id: 924004016)

16Report to the nations: Behold! Announce over Jerusalem, Guards are coming from the distant land, and they give their voice against the cities of Judah.


## Jeremiah 4:17 (id: 924004017)

17Like the watchmen of a field they will be around against her, since she has been rebellious {against} me —the declaration of Yahweh—


## Jeremiah 4:18 (id: 924004018)

18your way and your deeds have done these to you. This {is} your evil. Indeed {it is} bitter! Indeed it reaches as far as your heart!


## Jeremiah 4:19 (id: 924004019)

19My inward parts! My inward parts! I writhe in pain {in} the walls of my heart! My heart is turbulent for me. I shall not be silent, for I hear the sound of the horn, my soul, an alarm for battle.


## Jeremiah 4:20 (id: 924004020)

20Collapse upon collapse is called out, for all the land is devastated. Suddenly my tents are devastated, in a moment, my curtains!


## Jeremiah 4:21 (id: 924004021)

21Until when will I see the banner, will I hear the sound of the horn?


## Jeremiah 4:22 (id: 924004022)

22For my people {are} foolish; they do not know me. They {are} foolish sons and they have no understanding. They {are} wise to do evil, but do not know to do good.


## Jeremiah 4:23 (id: 924004023)

23I saw the land, and behold, {it was} formless and empty, and to the heavens, and there was not their light.


## Jeremiah 4:24 (id: 924004024)

24I saw the mountains. and behold, they were quaking, and all the hills were shaking themselves.


## Jeremiah 4:25 (id: 924004025)

25I saw, and behold, there was not the man, and all the birds of the heavens had fled.


## Jeremiah 4:26 (id: 924004026)

26I saw, and behold, the orchard {was} the wilderness, and all the cities had been pulled down before the face of Yahweh, before the face of the fury of his nose.”


## Jeremiah 4:27 (id: 924004027)

27For thus says Yahweh, “All the land will become a devastation, but complete destruction I shall not make.


## Jeremiah 4:28 (id: 924004028)

28Because of this the land will mourn, and the heavens will darken from above. Because I have spoken my plans and will not regret, and I shall not turn away from it.


## Jeremiah 4:29 (id: 924004029)

29From the noise of the horseman and the shooter of the bow every city will flee. They will go into the thickets and ascend onto the hollowed out rocks. Every city will be abandoned, and there will be no man dwelling in them.


## Jeremiah 4:30 (id: 924004030)

30And you, what will you do {for} the devastated one? Although you dress {in} scarlet, although you adorn yourself {with} jewelry of gold, although you tear open your eyes with eye paint, you beautify yourself for futility. The ones lusting reject you; they seek your life.


## Jeremiah 4:31 (id: 924004031)

31For I hear a sound like a woman in labor, distress like a woman birthing her firstborn, the sound of the daughter of Zion; she gasps for breath. She spreads out her hands, ‘Woe now to me, for my spirit faints {because of} murderers!.’”


## Jeremiah 5:1 (id: 924005001)

1“Roam about in the streets of Jerusalem, and see now and know and seek in her plazas! If you can find a man, if there is one who does justice, who seeks honesty, then I will forgive her.


## Jeremiah 5:2 (id: 924005002)

2And if they say, ‘{As} Yahweh {is} alive,’ surely they swear for falsehood.”


## Jeremiah 5:3 (id: 924005003)

3Yahweh, {are} not your eyes for honesty? You struck them, but they do not tremble. You have completely defeated them; they refuse to receive discipline. They harden their faces more than rock; they refuse to return.


## Jeremiah 5:4 (id: 924005004)

4So I myself said, “They are only ones who are poor. They are foolish, for they do not know the way of Yahweh, the ordinance of their God.


## Jeremiah 5:5 (id: 924005005)

5I shall go for myself to the great ones and speak {to} them, for they themselves know the way of Yahweh, the ordinance of their God.” But they together broke the yoke; they tore to pieces the fetters.


## Jeremiah 5:6 (id: 924005006)

6Therefore a lion from the thicket will strike them down; a wolf of the deserts will devastate them; a leopard watches over their cities; all who go out from there will be torn apart, for their transgressions increase; their apostasies are numerous.


## Jeremiah 5:7 (id: 924005007)

7How, for this, could I forgive you? Your sons have abandoned me and have sworn by not\-gods. And I satisfied them, but they committed adultery and assembled themselves {to} the house of the prostitute.


## Jeremiah 5:8 (id: 924005008)

8{They were} well\-fed, lusty horses. {Each} man neighed to the wife of his neighbor.


## Jeremiah 5:9 (id: 924005009)

9Should I not punish because of these —the declaration of Yahweh— or even against a nation that {is} like this, should I not avenge myself?


## Jeremiah 5:10 (id: 924005010)

10Go up onto her terraces and destroy! But do not bring complete destruction. Remove her vines, for they {are} not of Yahweh.


## Jeremiah 5:11 (id: 924005011)

11For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have utterly betrayed me —the declaration of Yahweh.


## Jeremiah 5:12 (id: 924005012)

12They have denied Yahweh, and they said, “He {is} not, and no evil will come upon us, and we will not see sword or famine.


## Jeremiah 5:13 (id: 924005013)

13And the prophets are for wind, and the word is not in them, thus it will be done to them.”


## Jeremiah 5:14 (id: 924005014)

14So thus says Yahweh the God of hosts: “Because you have spoken this word, behold, I shall place my word in your mouth for a fire, and this people {will be} wood! And it will consume them.

## Jeremiah 5:22 (id: 924005022)

12And their houses will be turned over to others, fields and wives altogether. For I shall stretch out my hand against the inhabitants of the land —the declaration of Yahweh.


## Jeremiah 6:13 (id: 924006013)

6if you do not oppress the stranger, the fatherless one, or the widow and do not pour out innocent blood in this place, and do not walk after other gods to your harm—

7then I will cause you to settle in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers from ancient times and to eternity.

9Are {you} stealing, murdering, and committing adultery and swearing for deceit and offering incense to Baal and walking after other gods whom you have not known,


## Jeremiah 7:10 (id: 924007010)

10then you come and stand before my face in this house over which my name is called and say, “We are saved,” in order to do all of these abominations?


## Jeremiah 7:11 (id: 924007011)

11Has this house, over which my name is called, become a cave of robbers in your eyes? Behold, I myself have also seen—the declaration of Yahweh.

## Jeremiah 7:13 (id: 924007013)

13So now, on account of your doing all of these deeds—the declaration of Yahweh—and I spoke to you rising early and speaking, but you did not listen. And I called you, but you did not answer.


## Jeremiah 7:14 (id: 924007014)

14And I shall do to this house over which my name is called, the house in which you have trusted, and this place that I gave to you and your fathers, as I did to Shiloh.

## Jeremiah 7:17 (id: 924007017)

17Do you not see what they are doing in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?


## Jeremiah 7:18 (id: 924007018)

18The sons are collecting wood and the fathers kindling the fire, and the women are kneading dough to make cakes for the queen of the heavens and pour out drink offerings for other gods in order to provoke me to anger!


## Jeremiah 7:19 (id: 924007019)

19Are they provoking me to anger?—the declaration of Yahweh—{is it} not them, in order to shame their faces?


## Jeremiah 7:20 (id: 924007020)

20Therefore thus says Lord Yahweh, ‘Behold, my nose and my heat will gush out onto this place—on man and on beast and on the tree of the field and on the fruit of the ground. And it will burn and not be extinguished.’


## Jeremiah 7:21 (id: 924007021)

## Jeremiah 7:24 (id: 924007024)

24But they did not listen and they did not incline their ear. And they walked by schemes in the stubbornness of their evil heart, and they went to the back and not to the face.


## Jeremiah 7:25 (id: 924007025)

25From the day when your fathers went out from the land of Egypt until this day, then I have sent all of my servants, my prophets, to you; {each} day rising early and sending.


## Jeremiah 7:26 (id: 924007026)

26But they did not listen to me, and they did not incline their ear, and they hardened their neck. They were more wicked than their fathers.’


## Jeremiah 7:27 (id: 924007027)

27So you will speak all these words to them, but they will not listen to you. And you will call out to them, but they will not answer.


## Jeremiah 7:28 (id: 924007028)

28And you will say to them: This {is} the nation that does not listen to the voice of Yahweh its God and does not receive discipline. Honesty is lost and cut off from their mouth.


## Jeremiah 7:29 (id: 924007029)

29Shear your consecration {hair} and throw {it} away. And lift up on the bare heights a funeral song. For Yahweh has rejected and abandoned the generation of his rage.

31Then they built the high places of Topheth which {are} in the Valley of Ben Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in fire—which I did not command, and it did not come up to my heart.


## Jeremiah 7:32 (id: 924007032)

2And they will spread them out to the sun and to the moon and to all of the armies of the heavens that they loved them and that they served them, and that they walked after them and that they sought them, and that they bowed down to them. They will not be gathered, and they will not be buried again. They will be for dung on the face of the land.


## Jeremiah 8:3 (id: 924008003)

5Why {is} this people, Jerusalem, turned, enduring apostasy? They grasp upon deceit and refuse to turn.


## Jeremiah 8:6 (id: 924008006)

6I paid attention and listened, they did not speak right. There was not a man sorry because of his wickedness, saying, “What have I done?” All of them turn in their running, like a stallion plunging into battle.


## Jeremiah 8:7 (id: 924008007)

7Even the stork in the heavens knows its times, and a dove, and a swift one, and a crane keep the time of their coming, and my people do not know the judgment of Yahweh.


## Jeremiah 8:8 (id: 924008008)

11They healed the breaking of the daughter of my people upon being light, saying, “Peace, Peace,” and there is not peace.


## Jeremiah 8:12 (id: 924008012)

12Were they ashamed when they did an abomination? Even being ashamed, they were not ashamed, they did not know to be humiliated! Therefore they will fall among the fallen, they will stumble in the time of their visitation says Yahweh.


## Jeremiah 8:13 (id: 924008013)

20The harvest has passed, summer has ended, and we have not been delivered.

2Thus says Yahweh, ‘Do not train upon the way of the nations, and do not be dismayed from the signs of the heavens, for the nations are dismayed from them.


## Jeremiah 10:3 (id: 924010003)

3For the customs of the people are vain, for a tree from the forest they cut it down, the hands of a craftsman making with an axe.


## Jeremiah 10:4 (id: 924010004)

4Then they decorate it with silver and gold. They strengthen it with hammers and nails, and it will not totter.


## Jeremiah 10:5 (id: 924010005)

5They {are} like scarecrows of a cucumber field, and they do not speak, carrying, they are carried because they do not walk. Do not fear from them, for they will not cause harm, and also there is not good with them.’”


## Jeremiah 10:6 (id: 924010006)

6There is not one like you, Yahweh. You are great, and your name is great in power.


## Jeremiah 10:7 (id: 924010007)

7Who does not fear you, king of the nations? For it is fitting to you, for there is no one like you among all the wise of the nations and among all of their kingdoms.


## Jeremiah 10:8 (id: 924010008)

8And with one they are stupid and foolish, the teaching of vain things of wood it {is}.


## Jeremiah 10:9 (id: 924010009)

9Hammered silver from Tarshish was brought, and gold from Uphaz, the work of a craftsman, and the hands of refiners. Their clothes {are} purple and reddish\-purple cloth. The work of skilled ones {are} all of them.


## Jeremiah 10:10 (id: 924010010)

10And Yahweh {is} the true God, he {is} the living God and eternal king. The earth quakes from his anger, and the nations cannot endure his indignation.


## Jeremiah 10:11 (id: 924010011)

11You will speak to them like this, “The gods that did not make the heavens and earth will perish from the earth and from under these heavens.”


## Jeremiah 10:12 (id: 924010012)

12the maker of the earth by his strength, the establisher of the world by his wisdom, and by his understanding he stretched out the heavens.


## Jeremiah 10:13 (id: 924010013)

13Of the sound of his giving, tumult of waters in the heavens, and he brings up the mists from the ends of the earth, he made the lightning for the rain, and sends out wind from his storehouse.


## Jeremiah 10:14 (id: 924010014)

14Every man has become stupid from knowledge. Every metalworker is put to shame from his idols, for his molten images are false, no spirit {is} in them.


## Jeremiah 10:15 (id: 924010015)

15They are vain, the work of mockery; they will perish at the time of their visitation.


## Jeremiah 10:16 (id: 924010016)

16Not like these {is} the portion of Jacob, for he {is} the molder of all things, and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance. Yahweh of hosts {is} his name.


## Jeremiah 10:17 (id: 924010017)

## Jeremiah 10:20 (id: 924010020)

20My tent is devastated, and all of my cords are ripped apart. My sons have gone out {from} me and they are not. There is not one spreading out my tent again, raising up my tent curtains.


## Jeremiah 10:21 (id: 924010021)

21For the shepherds are stupid and they do not seek Yahweh, because of this they have not prospered, and all their flock has been scattered.


## Jeremiah 10:22 (id: 924010022)

22The sound of a report, “Behold! It is coming, and a great earthquake from the land of the north, to appoint the cities of Judah a ruin, a dwelling place of jackals.”

## Jeremiah 11:1 (id: 924011001)

1The word that was to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,


## Jeremiah 11:2 (id: 924011002)

2“Hear the words of this covenant, and speak them to each one of Judah and upon the dwellers of Jerusalem


## Jeremiah 11:3 (id: 924011003)

3and say to them, ‘Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, ‘“Cursed is the man who does not hear the words of this covenant,


## Jeremiah 11:4 (id: 924011004)

4that which I commanded your fathers on the day of my bringing them out from the land of Egypt, from the furnace of iron, saying, “‘“Listen upon my voice and do them, as everything that I command you, and you will be to me for a people and I will be to you for a God,


## Jeremiah 11:5 (id: 924011005)

5for the sake of standing the oath that I swore to your fathers, giving to them the land flowing of milk and honey, as this day.’” Then I, Jeremiah, answered and said, “Truly, Yahweh!”


## Jeremiah 11:6 (id: 924011006)

6And Yahweh said to me, “Proclaim all these things in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem. Say, ‘Listen to the words of this covenant and carry them out.


## Jeremiah 11:7 (id: 924011007)

7For warning, I warned upon your ancestors in the day I caused them to go up from the land of Egypt until this day, persisting and warning saying, “Listen upon my voice."


## Jeremiah 11:8 (id: 924011008)

8And they did not listen and they did not stretch out their ear, and each one has walked in the stubbornness of their wicked heart, and I brought upon them all of the words of this covenant that I commanded to do, and they did not do.”


## Jeremiah 11:9 (id: 924011009)

9And Yahweh said to me, “A conspiracy has been found among the men of Judah and among the dwellers of Jerusalem.


## Jeremiah 11:10 (id: 924011010)

10They have returned upon the iniquities of their first fathers, who refused to listen to my words, and they walked after other gods to serve them. The house of Israel and the house of Judah broke my covenant that I cut with their fathers.


## Jeremiah 11:11 (id: 924011011)

11Therefore thus says Yahweh, ‘Behold, I {am} bringing calamity to them, that they will not be able to go out from it, and they will call out to me, and I will not listen to them.


## Jeremiah 11:12 (id: 924011012)

12And the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and call out to the gods that they {are} offering to them, and saving they will not save them at the time of their calamity.


## Jeremiah 11:13 (id: 924011013)

13For the number of your cities are your gods, O Judah, and the number of the streets of Jerusalem, you have appointed altars of shame, altars of sacrificing to Baal.


## Jeremiah 11:14 (id: 924011014)

14And you, do not pray for this people. Do not lift up a cry and a prayer on their behalf, for there is not me listening in the time of their calling to me on account of their calamity.


## Jeremiah 11:15 (id: 924011015)

15What is to my beloved one in my house, her doing much evil? The flesh of the holy thing they pass over from upon you, for then you rejoice of your evil.


## Jeremiah 11:16 (id: 924011016)

16Yahweh called your name a leafy, beautiful olive tree, fruit of good appearance. Of the sound of a great roaring he kindled a fire upon her, and its branches were bad.


## Jeremiah 11:17 (id: 924011017)

17And Yahweh of hosts, the one who planted you, has spoken calamity against you because of the wickedness of the house of Israel and the house of Judah which they did for themselves, to anger me, offering to Baal.’


## Jeremiah 11:18 (id: 924011018)

18Yahweh made me know, and I know. Then Yahweh made me see their deeds.


## Jeremiah 11:19 (id: 924011019)

19I was like a gentle lamb being led for slaughtering, and I did not know that they had planned plans against me, ‘Let us destroy the tree with its fruit! And let us cut him off from the land of the living, and his name will not be remembered any longer.’


## Jeremiah 11:20 (id: 924011020)

20And Yahweh of hosts {is} a righteous judges, examining the kidneys and the heart. I will see your vengeance from them, for I have uncovered my dispute to you.


## Jeremiah 11:21 (id: 924011021)

21Therefore thus says Yahweh concerning the men of Anathoth who {are} seeking your life saying, “You shall not prophesy in the name of Yahweh, and you will not die by our hand.”


## Jeremiah 11:22 (id: 924011022)

22Therefore thus says Yahweh of armies, ‘Behold, I {am} visiting against them. The chosen young men will die by the sword. Their sons and their daughters will die by famine,


## Jeremiah 11:23 (id: 924011023)

23and a remnant will not be to them, for I will bring calamity to the men of Anathoth, a year of their visitation.’”


## Jeremiah 12:1 (id: 924012001)

1You {are} righteous, Yahweh, when I argue to you. I will surely speak with you of my cases: Why {is} the way of the wicked successful? All of the treacherous ones of the treacherous are at ease.


## Jeremiah 12:2 (id: 924012002)

2You planted them, also they took root. They grew, also they produced fruit. You {are} near to them in their mouths, and far away from their kidneys.


## Jeremiah 12:3 (id: 924012003)

3And you, O Yahweh, know me. You see me and you test my heart with you. Lure them away like sheep for slaughtering, and set them apart for the day of slaughter!


## Jeremiah 12:4 (id: 924012004)

4Until when will the land dry up and the plants in every field wither from the wickedness of those dwelling in it? The animals and the birds have been taken away, for they say, “He will not see our end.”


## Jeremiah 12:5 (id: 924012005)

5For you have run with foot soldiers and they have worn you out, how will you compete with horses? You {are} trusting in a land of peace, how will you do in the majesty of the Jordan?


## Jeremiah 12:6 (id: 924012006)

6For even your brothers and your father’s house, even they have betrayed you, even they have called after you fully. Do not trust in them, for they speak good things to you.


## Jeremiah 12:7 (id: 924012007)

7I have abandoned my house, I have left my inheritance. I have given the beloved of my life into the hand of her enemies.


## Jeremiah 12:8 (id: 924012008)

8My inheritance has become to me like a lion in a forest, she has set against me with her voice, because of this I hate her.


## Jeremiah 12:9 (id: 924012009)

9Is my inheritance to me speckled birds of prey, birds of prey surrounding against her? Go, gather all the animals of the field, bring them to eat.


## Jeremiah 12:10 (id: 924012010)

10Many shepherds have ruined my vineyard. They have trampled my portion, they appointed the portion of my delight for a wilderness, a desolation.


## Jeremiah 12:11 (id: 924012011)

11He set her for a desolation, she mourns upon me, a desolation. All the land has been made desolate, for there is not a man setting upon the heart.


## Jeremiah 12:12 (id: 924012012)

12Destroyers have come against all the bare places in the wilderness, for the sword of Yahweh {is} consuming from the end of the land until the end of the land. There is not peace for any flesh.


## Jeremiah 12:13 (id: 924012013)

13They have sown wheat and harvested thorn bushes. They have become worn out, they did not profit, and they were ashamed from your produce, from the anger of the face of Yahweh.”


## Jeremiah 12:14 (id: 924012014)

14Thus says Yahweh against all my wicked neighbors who strike at the possession that I made my people Israel possess, “Behold, I {am} pulling them up from upon their ground, and I will pluck up the house of Judah from their midst.


## Jeremiah 12:15 (id: 924012015)

15And it will happen after my plucking them up, I will turn and have compassion on them and bring them back, each one to his inheritance and each one to his land.


## Jeremiah 12:16 (id: 924012016)

16And it will happen, if learning, they learn the ways of my people, to swear upon my name ‘As Yahweh lives’ just as they have taught my people to swear upon Baal, they will be built in the midst of my people.


## Jeremiah 12:17 (id: 924012017)

17And if they do not listen, and I will pluck up that nation, it will be plucked up and destroyed—the declaration of Yahweh.”


## Jeremiah 13:1 (id: 924013001)

1Thus says Yahweh to me, “Go and buy a linen loincloth for yourself and put it around your hips, and do not put it in water.”


## Jeremiah 13:2 (id: 924013002)

2And I bought a loincloth as Yahweh spoke, and I put it around my hips.


## Jeremiah 13:3 (id: 924013003)

3And the word of Yahweh was to me a second time, saying,


## Jeremiah 13:4 (id: 924013004)

4“Take the loincloth that you purchased, that {is} around your hips, and rise, go to Perath and hide it there in a cleft of a rock.”


## Jeremiah 13:5 (id: 924013005)

5And I went and hid it in Perath, just as Yahweh commanded me.


## Jeremiah 13:6 (id: 924013006)

6And it happened from the end of many days, and Yahweh said to me, “Rise, go back to Perath, and take from there the loincloth that I commanded you to hide there.”


## Jeremiah 13:7 (id: 924013007)

7And I went to Perath and dug and I took the loincloth from the place that I hid it there, and behold, the loincloth ruined, it was not useful for anything.


## Jeremiah 13:8 (id: 924013008)

8And the word of Yahweh was to me, saying,


## Jeremiah 13:9 (id: 924013009)

9“Thus says Yahweh, ‘Thus I will destroy the great majesty of Judah and Jerusalem.


## Jeremiah 13:10 (id: 924013010)

10This wicked people who refuses to listen to my word, who walk in the hardness of their heart, who go after other gods to worship them and bow down to them—they will be like this undergarment that is good for nothing.


## Jeremiah 13:11 (id: 924013011)

11For just as an undergarment clings to someone’s hips, so I have made all the house of Israel and all the house of Judah cling to me—this is Yahweh’s declaration—to be my people, to bring me fame, praise, and honor. But they would not listen to me.


## Jeremiah 13:12 (id: 924013012)

12So you must speak this word to them, ‘Yahweh, the God of Israel, says this: Every jar will be filled with wine.’ They will say to you, ‘Do we not indeed know that every jar will be filled with wine?’


## Jeremiah 13:13 (id: 924013013)

13So say to them, ‘Yahweh says this: See, I am about to fill with drunkenness every inhabitant of this land, the kings who sit on David’s throne, the priests, prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem.


## Jeremiah 13:14 (id: 924013014)

14Then I will smash each man against his brother, fathers and children together—this is Yahweh’s declaration—I will not pity them or have compassion, and I will not spare them from destruction.’”


## Jeremiah 13:15 (id: 924013015)

15Listen and pay attention. Do not be arrogant, for Yahweh had spoken.


## Jeremiah 13:16 (id: 924013016)

16Give honor to Yahweh your God before he brings darkness, and before he causes your feet to stumble on the mountains at twilight. For you are hoping for light, but he will turn the place into a deep darkness, into a dark cloud.


## Jeremiah 13:17 (id: 924013017)

17So if you will not listen, I will weep alone because of your arrogance. My eyes will certainly weep and flow with tears, for Yahweh’s flock has been taken captive.


## Jeremiah 13:18 (id: 924013018)

18“Say to the king and to the queen, ‘Come down from your thrones, for your splendid crowns have fallen from your heads.’


## Jeremiah 13:19 (id: 924013019)

19The cities in the Negev will be shut up, with no one to open them. All Judah will be taken captive, completely taken captive.


## Jeremiah 13:20 (id: 924013020)

20Lift up your eyes and look at the ones coming from the north. Where is the flock he gave to you, the flock that was so beautiful to you?


## Jeremiah 13:21 (id: 924013021)

21What will you say when God sets over you those you had trained to be your special allies? Are these not the beginnings of the labor pains that will seize you just like a woman in childbirth?


## Jeremiah 13:22 (id: 924013022)

22Then you might say in your heart, ‘Why are these things happening to me?’ It will be for the multitude of your iniquities that your skirts are raised up and you have been violated.


## Jeremiah 13:23 (id: 924013023)

23Can the people of Cush change their skin color, or can a leopard change its spots? If so, then you yourself, although accustomed to wickedness, would be able to do good.


## Jeremiah 13:24 (id: 924013024)

24So I will scatter them like chaff that perishes in the desert wind.


## Jeremiah 13:25 (id: 924013025)

25This is what I have given to you, the portion I have decreed for you—this is Yahweh’s declaration— because you have forgotten me and trusted in deceit.


## Jeremiah 13:26 (id: 924013026)

26So also I myself will strip your skirts off you, and your private parts will be seen.


## Jeremiah 13:27 (id: 924013027)

27I have seen your adultery and neighing, the wickedness of your prostitution on the hills and in the fields, these detestable things! Woe to you, Jerusalem! How long until you are made clean again?”


## Jeremiah 14:1 (id: 924014001)

1This is the word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah regarding the drought,


## Jeremiah 14:2 (id: 924014002)

2“Let Judah mourn; let her gates fall apart. They are wailing for the land; their cries for Jerusalem are going up.


## Jeremiah 14:3 (id: 924014003)

3Their mighty ones send out their servants for water. When they go to the trenches, they cannot find water. They all return with empty vessels; they cover their heads ashamed and dishonored.


## Jeremiah 14:4 (id: 924014004)

4Because of this the ground is cracked, for there is no rain in the land. The plowmen are ashamed and cover their heads.


## Jeremiah 14:5 (id: 924014005)

5For even the doe abandons her young in the fields, for there is no grass.


## Jeremiah 14:6 (id: 924014006)

6The wild donkeys stand on the bare plains and they pant in the wind like jackals. Their eyes fail to work, for there is no vegetation.”


## Jeremiah 14:7 (id: 924014007)

7Even though our iniquities testify against us, Yahweh, act for the sake of your name. For our faithless actions increase; we have sinned against you.


## Jeremiah 14:8 (id: 924014008)

8You are the Hope of Israel, the one who saves him in the time of distress. Why will you be like a stranger in the land, like a foreign wanderer who stretches out and spends just one night?


## Jeremiah 14:9 (id: 924014009)

9Why are you like someone who is astounded, or like a warrior who has no power to rescue? You are in our midst, Yahweh, and your name is called over us. Do not leave us!


## Jeremiah 14:10 (id: 924014010)

10Yahweh says this to this people: “Since they love to wander, they have not held back their feet from doing so.” Yahweh is not pleased with them. Now he calls to mind their iniquity and has punished their sins.


## Jeremiah 14:11 (id: 924014011)

11Yahweh said to me, “Do not pray for good on behalf of this people.


## Jeremiah 14:12 (id: 924014012)

12For if they fast, I will not listen to their wailing, and if they offer up burnt offerings and food offerings, I will not take pleasure in them. For I will put an end to them by sword, famine, and plague.”


## Jeremiah 14:13 (id: 924014013)

13Then I said, “Oh, Lord Yahweh! Behold! The prophets are saying to the people, ‘You will not see the sword; there will be no famine for you, for I will give you true security in this place.’”


## Jeremiah 14:14 (id: 924014014)

14Yahweh said to me, “The prophets prophesy deceit in my name. I did not send them out, nor did I give them any command or speak to them. But deceitful visions and useless, deceitful divination coming from their own minds are what they are prophesying to you.”


## Jeremiah 14:15 (id: 924014015)

15Therefore Yahweh says this, “About the prophets prophesying in my name but whom I did not send out—those who say there will be no sword or famine in this land: These prophets will perish by sword and famine.


## Jeremiah 14:16 (id: 924014016)

16Then the people to whom they prophesied will be thrown out in the streets of Jerusalem because of famine and sword, for there will be no one to bury them—them, their wives, their sons, or their daughters—for I will pour out their wickedness on them.


## Jeremiah 14:17 (id: 924014017)

17Say this word to them: ‘Let my eyes flow with tears, night and day. Do not let them stop, for there will be a great collapse of the virgin daughter of my people— a great and incurable wound.


## Jeremiah 14:18 (id: 924014018)

18If I go out to the field, there are the ones who were killed by the sword! If I come to the city, there are the diseases that are caused by famine. Both the prophet and the priest wander about the land, and they do not know.’”


## Jeremiah 14:19 (id: 924014019)

19Have you completely rejected Judah? Do you hate Zion? Why will you afflict us when there is no healing for us? We hoped for peace, but there was nothing good— and for a time of healing, but see, there is only terror.


## Jeremiah 14:20 (id: 924014020)

20We admit, Yahweh, our offenses, the iniquity of our ancestors, for we have sinned against you.


## Jeremiah 14:21 (id: 924014021)

21Do not reject us! For the sake of your name, do not make your glorious throne a disgrace. Remember and do not break your covenant with us.


## Jeremiah 14:22 (id: 924014022)

22Do any of the worthless idols of the nations bring rain? Or can the skies themselves send down showers? Are you not the one, Yahweh our God? We wait for you, for you are the one who does all these things.


## Jeremiah 15:1 (id: 924015001)

1Then Yahweh said to me, “Even if Moses or Samuel were standing in front of me, I would still not be in favor of this people. Send them out from before me, for them to go away.


## Jeremiah 15:2 (id: 924015002)

2It will happen that they will say to you, ‘Where should we go?’ Then you must say to them, ‘Yahweh says this: Those who are for death should go to death; those who are for the sword should go to the sword. Those who are for famine should go to famine; and those who are for captivity should go to captivity.’


## Jeremiah 15:3 (id: 924015003)

3For I will assign them to four groups—this is Yahweh’s declaration—the sword to slaughter some, the dogs to drag some away, the birds of the skies and the beast of the earth to consume and destroy some.


## Jeremiah 15:4 (id: 924015004)

4I will make of them a horrifying thing to all the kingdoms of the earth, because of what Manasseh son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, did in Jerusalem.


## Jeremiah 15:5 (id: 924015005)

5For who will have compassion for you, Jerusalem? Who will grieve for you? Who will turn aside to ask about your well\-being?


## Jeremiah 15:6 (id: 924015006)

6You have forsaken me—this is Yahweh’s declaration—you have gone back from me. So I will strike you with my hand and destroy you. I am tired of having mercy on you.


## Jeremiah 15:7 (id: 924015007)

7So I will winnow them with a pitchfork at the gates of the land. I will bereave them. I will destroy my people since they will not turn from their ways.


## Jeremiah 15:8 (id: 924015008)

8I will make their widows number more than the sands of the seashore. Against the mothers of young men I will send the destroyer at noonday. I will make shock and horror suddenly fall on them.


## Jeremiah 15:9 (id: 924015009)

9The mother who has borne seven children will waste away. She will gasp. Her sun will set while it is still day. She will be ashamed and embarrassed, for I will give those who remain to the sword in the presence of their enemies— this is Yahweh’s declaration.”


## Jeremiah 15:10 (id: 924015010)

10Woe to me, my mother! For you have borne me, I who am a man of controversy and argument through all the land. I have not lent, nor has anyone lent to me, but they all curse me.


## Jeremiah 15:11 (id: 924015011)

11Yahweh said: “Will I not rescue you for good? I will certainly make your enemies beg for help in the time of calamity and distress.


## Jeremiah 15:12 (id: 924015012)

12Can one smash iron? Especially iron from the north that is mixed with bronze?


## Jeremiah 15:13 (id: 924015013)

13I will give to your enemies your wealth and treasures as free plunder. I will do this because of all your sins committed within all your borders.


## Jeremiah 15:14 (id: 924015014)

14Then I will make you serve your enemies in a land that you do not know, for a fire will ignite, kindled in my wrath against you.”


## Jeremiah 15:15 (id: 924015015)

15Yahweh, you know! Remember me and help me. Bring vengeance for me against those who persecute me. You are patient, but do not allow them to take me away; know that I suffer reproach for your sake.


## Jeremiah 15:16 (id: 924015016)

16Your words have been found, and I consumed them. Your words became to me a joy and the delight of my heart, for I bear your name, Yahweh, God of hosts.


## Jeremiah 15:17 (id: 924015017)

17I did not sit in the circle of those who celebrated or rejoiced. I sat in solitude because of your powerful hand, for you filled me with indignation.


## Jeremiah 15:18 (id: 924015018)

18Why is my pain ongoing and my wound incurable, refusing to be healed? Will you be like deceitful waters to me, waters that dry up?


## Jeremiah 15:19 (id: 924015019)

19Therefore Yahweh said this, “If you repent, then I will restore you, and you will stand before me. For if you separate the foolish things from the precious things, you will be like my mouth. The people will come back to you, but you yourself must not go back to them.


## Jeremiah 15:20 (id: 924015020)

20I will make you like an impenetrable bronze wall to this people, and they will wage war against you. But they will not defeat you, for I am with you to save and rescue you—this is Yahweh’s declaration—


## Jeremiah 15:21 (id: 924015021)

21for I will rescue you from the hand of the wicked and redeem you from the hand of the tyrant.”


## Jeremiah 16:1 (id: 924016001)

1Then the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,


## Jeremiah 16:2 (id: 924016002)

2“Do not take a wife for yourself, and do not have sons or daughters for yourself in this place.


## Jeremiah 16:3 (id: 924016003)

3For Yahweh says this to the sons and daughters who are born in this place, to the mothers who bear them, and to the fathers who caused them to be born in this land,


## Jeremiah 16:4 (id: 924016004)

4‘They will die diseased deaths. They will not be mourned or buried. They will be like dung on the ground. For they will come to an end by sword and famine, and their corpses will be food for the birds of the skies and the beasts of the earth.’


## Jeremiah 16:5 (id: 924016005)

5For this says Yahweh, ‘Do not enter a house where there is mourning. Do not go to mourn or to show sympathy for them, for I have taken away my peace from this people—this is Yahweh’s declaration—and my covenant faithfulness and mercy.


## Jeremiah 16:6 (id: 924016006)

6Both the great and the small will die in this land. They will not be buried, and no one will mourn for them or cut themselves or shave their heads for them.


## Jeremiah 16:7 (id: 924016007)

7No one must share any food in mourning to comfort them because of the deaths, and none must give a comforting cup to his father or his mother.


## Jeremiah 16:8 (id: 924016008)

8You must not go to a banquet house to sit with them in order to eat or drink.’


## Jeremiah 16:9 (id: 924016009)

9For Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this, ‘See, before your eyes, in your days and in this place, I am about to put an end to the sound of joy and the sound of gladness, the sound of the groom and the sound of the bride.’


## Jeremiah 16:10 (id: 924016010)

10Then it will happen that you will report all these words to this people, and they will say to you, ‘Why has Yahweh decreed all this great disaster against us? What is our iniquity and sin that we sinned against Yahweh our God?’


## Jeremiah 16:11 (id: 924016011)

11So say to them, ‘Because your ancestors abandoned me—this is Yahweh’s declaration—and they went after other gods and worshiped and bowed down to them. They abandoned me and have not kept my law.


## Jeremiah 16:12 (id: 924016012)

12But you yourselves have brought about more wickedness than your ancestors, for see, each person is walking by the stubbornness of his wicked heart; there is no one who listens to me.


## Jeremiah 16:13 (id: 924016013)

13So I will throw you from this land to a land that you have not known, neither you nor your ancestors, and you will worship other gods there by day and night, for I will not give any favor to you.’


## Jeremiah 16:14 (id: 924016014)

14Therefore, behold, the days are coming—this is Yahweh’s declaration—when it will no longer be said, ‘As Yahweh lives, the one who brought up the people of Israel from the land of Egypt.’


## Jeremiah 16:15 (id: 924016015)

15but, ‘As Yahweh lives, the one who brought up the people of Israel from the land of the north and from the lands where he had scattered them.’ For I will bring them back to the land that I gave to their ancestors.


## Jeremiah 16:16 (id: 924016016)

16Behold! I will send for many fishermen—this is Yahweh’s declaration—so they will fish the people out. After this I will send for many hunters so they will hunt for them among all the mountains and hills, and in rock crevices.


## Jeremiah 16:17 (id: 924016017)

17For my eye is on all their ways; they cannot be hidden from before me. Their iniquity cannot be concealed from before my eyes.


## Jeremiah 16:18 (id: 924016018)

18I will first pay back double for their iniquity and sin for their polluting of my land with their disgusting idol figures, and for their filling my inheritance with their disgusting idols.”


## Jeremiah 16:19 (id: 924016019)

19Yahweh, you are my stronghold and my refuge, my place of safety in the day of distress. The nations will go to you from the ends of the earth and say, “Surely our ancestors inherited deceit. They are empty; there is no profit in them.


## Jeremiah 16:20 (id: 924016020)

20Do people make gods for themselves? But they are not gods.”


## Jeremiah 16:21 (id: 924016021)

21Therefore see! I will cause them to know in this time, I will cause them to know my hand and my power, so they will know that Yahweh is my name.


## Jeremiah 17:1 (id: 924017001)

1“The sin of Judah is written with an iron stylus having a diamond point. It is engraved on the tablet of their hearts and on the horns of your altars.


## Jeremiah 17:2 (id: 924017002)

2Even their children remember their altars and their Asherah poles that were beside the spreading trees and on the high hills.


## Jeremiah 17:3 (id: 924017003)

3My mountain in the open country, and your wealth and all your treasures I will give away as plunder, together with your high places, because of the sin you committed in all your territories.


## Jeremiah 17:4 (id: 924017004)

4You will lose the inheritance that I gave to you. I will enslave you to your enemies in a land that you do not know, for you have ignited a fire in my wrath, which will burn forever.”


## Jeremiah 17:5 (id: 924017005)

5Yahweh says, “The person who trusts in mankind is accursed; he makes flesh his strength but turns his heart away from Yahweh.


## Jeremiah 17:6 (id: 924017006)

6For he will be like a small bush in the Arabah and will not see anything good coming. He will stay in the arid places in the wilderness, barren land without inhabitants.


## Jeremiah 17:7 (id: 924017007)

7But the person who trusts in Yahweh is blessed, for Yahweh is his reason for confidence.


## Jeremiah 17:8 (id: 924017008)

8For he will be like a tree planted by water, its roots will spread out by the stream. It will not fear the heat when it comes, for its leaves are always green. It is not anxious in a year of drought, and it will not stop producing fruit.


## Jeremiah 17:9 (id: 924017009)

9The heart is more deceitful than anything else. It is sick; who can understand it?


## Jeremiah 17:10 (id: 924017010)

10I am Yahweh, the one who searches through the mind, who tests the hearts. I give to each person according to his ways, according to the fruit of his deeds.


## Jeremiah 17:11 (id: 924017011)

11A partridge hatches an egg that she did not lay. Someone may become rich unjustly, but when half his days are over, those riches will abandon him, and in the end he will be a fool.”


## Jeremiah 17:12 (id: 924017012)

12“The place of our temple is a glorious throne, elevated from the beginning.


## Jeremiah 17:13 (id: 924017013)

13Yahweh is the hope of Israel. All who abandon you will be put to shame; those who turn away from you will be written in the earth, for they have forsaken Yahweh, the fountain of living waters.


## Jeremiah 17:14 (id: 924017014)

14Heal me, Yahweh, and I will be healed! Rescue me, and I will be rescued. For you are my song of praise.


## Jeremiah 17:15 (id: 924017015)

15See, they are saying to me, ‘Where is the word of Yahweh? Let it come!’


## Jeremiah 17:16 (id: 924017016)

16As for me, I did not run from being a shepherd following you. I did not long for the day of disaster. You know the proclamations that came from my lips. They were made in your presence.


## Jeremiah 17:17 (id: 924017017)

17Do not be a terror to me. You are my refuge on the day of disaster.


## Jeremiah 17:18 (id: 924017018)

18May my pursuers be ashamed, but do not let me be ashamed. May they be dismayed, but do not let me be dismayed. Send the day of disaster against them and shatter them with a double share of destruction.”


## Jeremiah 17:19 (id: 924017019)

19Yahweh said this to me: “Go and stand in the gate of the people where the kings of Judah enter and where they exit, then in all the other gates of Jerusalem.


## Jeremiah 17:20 (id: 924017020)

20Say to them, ‘Hear the word of Yahweh, kings of Judah and all you people of Judah, and every resident of Jerusalem who comes in through these gates.


## Jeremiah 17:21 (id: 924017021)

21Yahweh says this: “Be careful for the sake of your lives and do not carry a burden on the Sabbath day to bring it to the gates of Jerusalem.


## Jeremiah 17:22 (id: 924017022)

22Do not bring a load out from your house on the Sabbath day. Do not do any work, but set apart the Sabbath day, just as I commanded your ancestors to do.”’


## Jeremiah 17:23 (id: 924017023)

23They did not listen or pay attention, but stiffened their neck so they would not hear me nor accept discipline.


## Jeremiah 17:24 (id: 924017024)

24It will happen that if you truly listen to me—this is Yahweh’s declaration—and do not bring a load to the gates of this city on the Sabbath day but instead set apart the Sabbath day to Yahweh and not do any work on it,


## Jeremiah 17:25 (id: 924017025)

25then kings, princes, and those who sit on David’s throne will come to the gates of this city in chariots and with horses, they and their leaders, men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem, and this city will be inhabited forever.


## Jeremiah 17:26 (id: 924017026)

26They will come from the cities of Judah and from all around Jerusalem, from the land of Benjamin and the lowlands, from the mountains, and from the Negev, bringing burnt offerings and sacrifices, grain offerings and frankincense, thank offerings to the house of Yahweh.


## Jeremiah 17:27 (id: 924017027)

27But if you do not listen to me—to set apart the Sabbath day and to not carry heavy loads and to not enter the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day—then I will light a fire in its gates, and it will consume the fortresses of Jerusalem, and it cannot be put out.”


## Jeremiah 18:1 (id: 924018001)

1The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,


## Jeremiah 18:2 (id: 924018002)

2“Arise and go out to the potter’s house, for I will have you hear my word there.”


## Jeremiah 18:3 (id: 924018003)

3So I went out to the potter’s house, and behold! The potter was working on the potter’s wheel.


## Jeremiah 18:4 (id: 924018004)

4But the pot he was making from the clay was spoiled in the potter’s hand, so he returned the clay and formed it into another pot, and he made it into an object that was pleasing in his eyes.


## Jeremiah 18:5 (id: 924018005)

5Then the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,


## Jeremiah 18:6 (id: 924018006)

6“Should I not be able to act like this potter with you, house of Israel?—this is Yahweh’s declaration. Behold! Like clay in a potter’s hand—that is how you are in my hand, house of Israel.


## Jeremiah 18:7 (id: 924018007)

7At one moment, I may proclaim something about a nation or a kingdom, that I will drive it out, tear it down, or destroy it.


## Jeremiah 18:8 (id: 924018008)

8But if the nation about which I have made that proclamation turns from its evil, then I will relent from the disaster that I was planning to bring upon it.


## Jeremiah 18:9 (id: 924018009)

9At another moment, I may proclaim something about a nation or a kingdom, that I will build it up or plant it.


## Jeremiah 18:10 (id: 924018010)

10But if it does evil in my eyes by not listening to my voice, then I will stop the good that I had said I would do for them.


## Jeremiah 18:11 (id: 924018011)

11So now, speak to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and say, ‘Yahweh says this: See, I am about to form disaster against you. I am about to devise a plan against you. Repent, each person from his wicked way, so your ways and your practices will bring good to you.’


## Jeremiah 18:12 (id: 924018012)

12But they will say, ‘This is no use. We will act according to our own plans. Each one of us will do what his evil, stubborn heart desires.’


## Jeremiah 18:13 (id: 924018013)

13Therefore Yahweh says this, ‘Ask the nations, who has ever heard of such a thing as this? The virgin Israel has committed a horrible act.


## Jeremiah 18:14 (id: 924018014)

14Does the snow in Lebanon ever leave the rocky hills on its sides? Are the mountain streams coming from far away ever destroyed, those cold streams?


## Jeremiah 18:15 (id: 924018015)

15Yet my people have forgotten me. They have made offerings to useless idols and been made to stumble in their paths; they have left the ancient paths to walk lesser paths.


## Jeremiah 18:16 (id: 924018016)

16Their land will become a horror, an object of everlasting hissing. Everyone who passes by her will shudder and shake his head.


## Jeremiah 18:17 (id: 924018017)

17I will scatter them before their enemies like an eastern wind. I will show them my back, and not my face, on the day of their disaster.’”


## Jeremiah 18:18 (id: 924018018)

18So the people said, “Come, let us make plots against Jeremiah, since the law will never perish from the priests, or advice from the wise men, or words from the prophets. Come, let us attack him with our words and no longer pay attention to anything he proclaims.”


## Jeremiah 18:19 (id: 924018019)

19Pay attention to me, Yahweh, and listen to the voice of my enemies.


## Jeremiah 18:20 (id: 924018020)

20Will disaster from them really be my reward for being good to them? For they have dug a pit for me. Remember how I stood before you to speak for their welfare, to cause your fury to turn away from them.


## Jeremiah 18:21 (id: 924018021)

21Therefore give their children over to famine, and give them to the hands of those who use the sword. So let their women become bereaved and widows, and their men be killed, and their young men killed by the sword in battle.


## Jeremiah 18:22 (id: 924018022)

22Let a distressed shout be heard from their houses, as you suddenly bring raiders against them. For they have dug a pit to capture me and have hidden traps for my feet.


## Jeremiah 18:23 (id: 924018023)

23But you, Yahweh, you know all of their plans against me to kill me. Do not forgive their iniquities and sins. Do not wipe their sins away from you. Instead, let them be overthrown before you. Act against them in the time of your wrath.


## Jeremiah 19:1 (id: 924019001)

1Yahweh said this, “Go and purchase a potter’s clay flask while you are with the elders of the people and the priests.


## Jeremiah 19:2 (id: 924019002)

2Then go out to the Valley of Ben Hinnom at the entry of the Broken Pottery Gate, and there proclaim the words that I will tell you.


## Jeremiah 19:3 (id: 924019003)

3Say, ‘Hear the word of Yahweh, kings of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem! Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this, “See, I am about to bring disaster on this place, and the ears of everyone who hears of it will tingle.


## Jeremiah 19:4 (id: 924019004)

4I will do this because they have abandoned me and profaned this place. In this place they offer sacrifices to other gods that they did not know. They, their ancestors, and the kings of Judah have also filled this place with innocent blood.


## Jeremiah 19:5 (id: 924019005)

5They built the high places of Baal to burn their sons in the fire as burnt offerings to him—something that I did not command or mention, nor did it enter my mind.


## Jeremiah 19:6 (id: 924019006)

6Therefore, see, the days are coming—this is Yahweh’s declaration—when this place will no longer be called Topheth, the Valley of Ben Hinnom, for it will be the Valley of Slaughter.


## Jeremiah 19:7 (id: 924019007)

7In this place I will make the plans of Judah and Jerusalem useless. I will make them to fall by the sword before their enemies and by the hand of the ones seeking their lives. Then I will give their corpses as food to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the earth.


## Jeremiah 19:8 (id: 924019008)

8Then I will make this city a ruin and the object of hissing, for everyone passing by it will shudder and hiss regarding all of its plagues.


## Jeremiah 19:9 (id: 924019009)

9I will make them eat the flesh of their sons and daughters; each man will consume the flesh of his neighbor in the siege and in the anguish brought on them by their enemies and the ones seeking their lives.”’


## Jeremiah 19:10 (id: 924019010)

10Then you will break the clay flask in the sight of the men who went with you.


## Jeremiah 19:11 (id: 924019011)

11You will say to them, ‘Yahweh of hosts says this: I will do this same thing to this people and this city just as Jeremiah shattered the clay flask so that it could not be repaired again. People will bury the dead in Topheth until there is no place left for any more dead.


## Jeremiah 19:12 (id: 924019012)

12This is what I will do to this place and its inhabitants when I make this city like Topheth—this is Yahweh’s declaration—


## Jeremiah 19:13 (id: 924019013)

13so the houses of Jerusalem and of the kings of Judah will become like Topheth—all the houses on whose rooftops the unclean people worship all the stars of the heavens and pour out drink offerings to other gods.’”


## Jeremiah 19:14 (id: 924019014)

14Then Jeremiah went from Topheth, where Yahweh had sent him to prophesy. He stood in the courtyard of Yahweh’s house and he said to all the people,


## Jeremiah 19:15 (id: 924019015)

15“Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this, ‘See, I am about to bring to this city and to all of its towns all the disaster that I have proclaimed against it, since they stiffened their neck and refused to listen to my words.’”


## Jeremiah 20:1 (id: 924020001)

1Pashhur son of Immer the priest—he was a leading officer—heard Jeremiah prophesying these words before Yahweh’s house.


## Jeremiah 20:2 (id: 924020002)

2So Pashhur beat Jeremiah the prophet and then placed him in the stocks that were at the Upper Gate of Benjamin in Yahweh’s house.


## Jeremiah 20:3 (id: 924020003)

3It happened on the next day that Pashhur brought Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then Jeremiah said to him, “Yahweh has not called your name Pashhur, but you are Magor Missabib.


## Jeremiah 20:4 (id: 924020004)

4For Yahweh says this, ‘Look, I will make you an object of horror, you and all of your loved ones, for they will fall by the sword of their enemies and your eyes will see it. I will give all of Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon. He will make them captives in Babylon or attack them with the sword.


## Jeremiah 20:5 (id: 924020005)

5I will give him all the wealth of this city and all of its riches, all of its precious items and all the treasures of the kings of Judah. I will place these things in the hand of your enemies, and they will seize them. They will take them and bring them to Babylon.


## Jeremiah 20:6 (id: 924020006)

6But you, Pashhur, and all the inhabitants of your house will go into captivity. You will go to Babylon and die there. You and all of your loved ones to whom you prophesied deceitful things will be buried there.’”


## Jeremiah 20:7 (id: 924020007)

7“Yahweh, you deceived me, and I was deceived. You are stronger than I, and you overpowered me. I have become a laughingstock all day long; everyone mocks me.


## Jeremiah 20:8 (id: 924020008)

8For whenever I have spoken, I have called out and proclaimed, ‘Violence and destruction.’ Then Yahweh’s word has become for me reproach and mocking every day.


## Jeremiah 20:9 (id: 924020009)

9If I say, ‘I will not think about Yahweh anymore. I will not speak any longer in his name.’ Then it is like a consuming fire in my heart, held within my bones. So I struggle to contain it but I cannot.


## Jeremiah 20:10 (id: 924020010)

10I have heard rumors of terror from many people all around. ‘Report! We must report it!’ Those who are close to me watch to see if I will fall. ‘Perhaps he can be tricked. If so, we can overpower him and take our revenge on him.’


## Jeremiah 20:11 (id: 924020011)

11But Yahweh is with me like a powerful warrior, so the ones pursuing me will stagger. They will not defeat me. They will be greatly ashamed, because they will not succeed. They will have unending shame, it will never be forgotten.


## Jeremiah 20:12 (id: 924020012)

12But Yahweh of hosts, you examine the righteous and see the mind and the heart. Let me see your vengeance on them for I have committed my cause to you.


## Jeremiah 20:13 (id: 924020013)

13Sing to Yahweh! Praise Yahweh! For he has rescued the lives of those who are oppressed from the hand of evildoers.


## Jeremiah 20:14 (id: 924020014)

14Let the day when I was born be cursed. Do not let the day that my mother bore me be blessed.


## Jeremiah 20:15 (id: 924020015)

15Let the man who informed my father be cursed, the one who said, ‘A male child has been born to you,’ causing great joy.


## Jeremiah 20:16 (id: 924020016)

16Let that man be like the cities that Yahweh overthrew and he did not have compassion on them. Let him hear a cry for help in the dawn, a battle cry at noontime,


## Jeremiah 20:17 (id: 924020017)

17because he did not kill me in the womb, making my mother to be my tomb, a womb that was pregnant forever.


## Jeremiah 20:18 (id: 924020018)

18Why is it that I came out from the womb to see troubles and agony, so that my days are filled with shame?”


## Jeremiah 21:1 (id: 924021001)

1The word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh when King Zedekiah sent Pashhur son of Malkijah and Zephaniah son of Maaseiah the priest to him, and they said,


## Jeremiah 21:2 (id: 924021002)

2“Please seek advice from Yahweh on our behalf, for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon is making war on us. Perhaps Yahweh will do miracles for us, as in times past, and will make him withdraw from us.”


## Jeremiah 21:3 (id: 924021003)

3So Jeremiah said to them, “This is what you must say to Zedekiah,


## Jeremiah 21:4 (id: 924021004)

4‘Yahweh, God of Israel, says this: See, I am about to turn back the instruments of war that are in your hand, with which you are fighting against the king of Babylon and the Chaldeans who are closing you in from outside the walls! For I will gather them in the middle of this city.


## Jeremiah 21:5 (id: 924021005)

5Then I myself will fight against you with a raised hand and a strong arm, and with wrath, fury, and great anger.


## Jeremiah 21:6 (id: 924021006)

6For I will attack the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast. They will die in a severe plague.


## Jeremiah 21:7 (id: 924021007)

7After this—this is Yahweh’s declaration—Zedekiah king of Judah, his servants, the people, and whoever remains in this city after the plague, the sword, and the famine, I will give them all into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those seeking their life. Then he will kill them with the edge of the sword. He will not pity them, spare them, or have compassion.’


## Jeremiah 21:8 (id: 924021008)

8Then to this people you must say, ‘Yahweh says this: See, I am about to place before you the way of life and the way of death.


## Jeremiah 21:9 (id: 924021009)

9Anyone staying in this city will die by the sword, famine, and plague; but anyone going out and falling on his knees before the Chaldeans who have closed in against you will live. He will escape with his life.


## Jeremiah 21:10 (id: 924021010)

10For I have set my face against this city in order to bring disaster and not to bring good—this is Yahweh’s declaration. It has been given into the hand of the king of Babylon and he will burn it.’


## Jeremiah 21:11 (id: 924021011)

11Concerning the house of the king of Judah, listen to the word of Yahweh.


## Jeremiah 21:12 (id: 924021012)

12House of David, Yahweh says, ‘Bring about justice in the morning. Rescue the one who has been robbed by the hand of the oppressor, or my fury will go out like fire and burn, and there is no one who can quench it, because of your evil deeds.


## Jeremiah 21:13 (id: 924021013)

13See, inhabitant of the valley! I am against you, rock of the plain—this is Yahweh’s declaration— I am against anyone who is saying, “Who will come down to attack us?” or “Who will enter our houses?”


## Jeremiah 21:14 (id: 924021014)

14I have assigned the fruit of your practices to come against you—this is Yahweh’s declaration— and I will light a fire in the thickets, and it will consume everything around it.’”


## Jeremiah 22:1 (id: 924022001)

1This is what Yahweh says, “Go down to the house of the king of Judah and proclaim this word there.


## Jeremiah 22:2 (id: 924022002)

2Say, ‘King of Judah, listen to the word of Yahweh—you who sit on David’s throne—you, and your servants, and your people who come through these gates.


## Jeremiah 22:3 (id: 924022003)

3Yahweh says this, “Perform justice and righteousness, and anyone who has been robbed—rescue him from the hand of the oppressor. Do not mistreat any foreigner in your land, or any orphan or widow. Do not commit violence or pour out innocent blood in this place.


## Jeremiah 22:4 (id: 924022004)

4For if you truly do these things, then kings sitting on David’s throne will enter the gates of this house riding in a chariot and on horses, he, his servants, and his people!


## Jeremiah 22:5 (id: 924022005)

5But if you do not listen to these words from me that I have announced—this is Yahweh’s declaration—then this royal house will become a ruin.”’


## Jeremiah 22:6 (id: 924022006)

6For Yahweh says this concerning the house of the king of Judah, ‘You are like Gilead, or like the summit of Lebanon to me. Yet I will turn you into a wilderness, into cities with no inhabitants.


## Jeremiah 22:7 (id: 924022007)

7For I have designated destroyers to come against you! Men with their weapons will cut off the best of your cedars and let them fall into the fire.


## Jeremiah 22:8 (id: 924022008)

8Then many nations will pass by this city. Each person will say to the next, “Why has Yahweh acted in this way toward this great city?”


## Jeremiah 22:9 (id: 924022009)

9Then the other will answer, “Because they abandoned the covenant of Yahweh their God and bowed down to other gods and worshiped them.”


## Jeremiah 22:10 (id: 924022010)

10Do not weep for the one who is dead or mourn for him; but weep bitterly for him who is about to go away, because he will never return and see his native land again.’


## Jeremiah 22:11 (id: 924022011)

11For Yahweh says this about Jehoahaz son of Josiah king of Judah, who served as king instead of Josiah his father, ‘He has gone from this place and will not come back.


## Jeremiah 22:12 (id: 924022012)

12He will die there in the place to where they have exiled him, and he will never again see this land.’


## Jeremiah 22:13 (id: 924022013)

13Woe to him who builds his house by unrighteousness, his upper rooms by injustice, who makes his neighbor work for him for nothing, and he does not give him his wages;


## Jeremiah 22:14 (id: 924022014)

14he says, ‘I will build for myself a large house with spacious upper rooms.’ So he cuts out large windows for it, and he panels it with cedar, and he paints it red.


## Jeremiah 22:15 (id: 924022015)

15Is this what makes you a good king, that you wanted to have boards of cedar? Did not your father also eat and drink, yet do justice and righteousness? Then things went well for him.


## Jeremiah 22:16 (id: 924022016)

16He judged in favor of the poor and needy. It was good then. Is this not what it means to know me?—this is Yahweh’s declaration.


## Jeremiah 22:17 (id: 924022017)

17But there is nothing in your eyes and heart except worry for your unjust profit and for pouring out innocent blood, for producing oppression and crushing of others.


## Jeremiah 22:18 (id: 924022018)

18Therefore this is what Yahweh says about Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah: They will not lament for him, saying, ‘Woe, my brother!’ or ‘Woe, my sister!’ They will not lament for him, saying, ‘Woe, master!’ or ‘Woe, majesty!’


## Jeremiah 22:19 (id: 924022019)

19He will be buried with a donkey’s burial, dragged away and thrown out beyond the gates of Jerusalem.


## Jeremiah 22:20 (id: 924022020)

20Go up Lebanon’s mountains and shout. Lift your voice in Bashan. Shout from the Abarim mountains, for all of your friends will be destroyed.


## Jeremiah 22:21 (id: 924022021)

21I spoke to you when you were safe, but you said, ‘I will not listen.’ This was your custom since your youth, for you have not listened to my voice.


## Jeremiah 22:22 (id: 924022022)

22The wind will shepherd away all your shepherds, and your friends will go into captivity. Then you will certainly be ashamed and humiliated by all of your evil deeds.


## Jeremiah 22:23 (id: 924022023)

23You who live in ‘Lebanon,’ who is nestled in cedar buildings, how you will be pitied when the labor pains come upon you, pain like that of a woman in labor!”


## Jeremiah 22:24 (id: 924022024)

24“As I live—this is Yahweh’s declaration—even if you, Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, were the signet on my right hand, I would tear you off.


## Jeremiah 22:25 (id: 924022025)

25For I have given you to the hand of the ones seeking your life and to the hand of those before whom you are afraid, even to the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and the Chaldeans.


## Jeremiah 22:26 (id: 924022026)

26I will throw you and your mother who bore you into another land, a country where you were not born, and there you will die.


## Jeremiah 22:27 (id: 924022027)

27About this land to which they will want to return, they will not come back here.


## Jeremiah 22:28 (id: 924022028)

28Is this a despised and shattered vessel? Is this man Jehoiachin a pot that pleases no one? Why have they thrown him and his descendants out, and have poured them out into a land that they did not know?


## Jeremiah 22:29 (id: 924022029)

29Land, Land, Land! Hear the word of Yahweh!


## Jeremiah 22:30 (id: 924022030)

30Yahweh says this, ‘Write about this man Jehoiachin: He will be childless. He will not prosper during his days, and no one among his descendants will achieve success or ever again sit on David’s throne and rule over Judah.’”


## Jeremiah 23:1 (id: 924023001)

1“Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture—this is Yahweh’s declaration.”


## Jeremiah 23:2 (id: 924023002)

2Therefore Yahweh, the God of Israel, says this concerning the shepherds who are shepherding his people, “You have scattered my flock and have driven them away. You have not cared for them. So I am about to punish you for the evil you have done—this is Yahweh’s declaration.


## Jeremiah 23:3 (id: 924023003)

3I myself will gather the remnant of my flock from all of the lands where I have driven them, and I will return them to a grazing place, where they will be fruitful and increase.


## Jeremiah 23:4 (id: 924023004)

4Then I will raise up shepherds over them who will shepherd them so they will no longer fear or be shattered. None of them will go missing—this is Yahweh’s declaration.


## Jeremiah 23:5 (id: 924023005)

5See, the days are coming—this is Yahweh’s declaration—when I will raise up for David a righteous branch. He will reign as king; he will act wisely and cause justice and righteousness in the land.


## Jeremiah 23:6 (id: 924023006)

6In his days Judah will be rescued, and Israel will live in security. Then this is the name by which he will be called: Yahweh is our righteousness.


## Jeremiah 23:7 (id: 924023007)

7Therefore see, days are coming—this is Yahweh’s declaration—when they will no longer say, ‘As Yahweh lives, who brought the people of Israel up from the land of Egypt.’


## Jeremiah 23:8 (id: 924023008)

8Instead they will say, ‘As Yahweh lives, who brought up and who led back the descendants of the house of Israel from the northern land and all the lands where they had been driven.’ Then they will live in their own land.”


## Jeremiah 23:9 (id: 924023009)

9Regarding the prophets, my heart is broken in me, and all of my bones tremble. I have become like a drunk man, like a man whom wine has overpowered, because of Yahweh and his holy words.


## Jeremiah 23:10 (id: 924023010)

10For the land is full of adulterers. Because of these the land is dried up. The meadows in the wilderness dry up. These prophets’ paths are wicked; their power is not used in a right manner.


## Jeremiah 23:11 (id: 924023011)

11“For both the prophets and the priests are polluted. I even found their wickedness in my house!—this is Yahweh’s declaration—


## Jeremiah 23:12 (id: 924023012)

12therefore their way will be like a slippery place in the darkness. They will be pushed down. They will fall in it. For I will send disaster against them in the year of their punishment—this is Yahweh’s declaration.


## Jeremiah 23:13 (id: 924023013)

13For I have seen the prophets in Samaria doing what is repulsive: They prophesied by Baal and led my people Israel astray.


## Jeremiah 23:14 (id: 924023014)

14Among the prophets in Jerusalem I have seen horrible things: They commit adultery and walk in deceit. They strengthen the hands of evildoers; no one turns back from his evildoing. All of them have become like Sodom to me and its inhabitants like Gomorrah!”


## Jeremiah 23:15 (id: 924023015)

15Therefore Yahweh of hosts says this concerning the prophets, “Look, I am about to make them eat wormwood and drink poisonous water, for pollution has gone out from the prophets of Jerusalem to all the land.”


## Jeremiah 23:16 (id: 924023016)

16Yahweh of hosts says this, “Do not listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you. They have deluded you! They are announcing visions from their own minds, not from Yahweh’s mouth.


## Jeremiah 23:17 (id: 924023017)

17They are constantly saying to those who dishonor me, ‘Yahweh declares there will be peace for you.’ For everyone walking in the stubbornness of his own heart says, ‘Disaster will not come upon you.’


## Jeremiah 23:18 (id: 924023018)

18Yet who has stood in Yahweh’s council meeting? Who sees and hears his word? Who pays attention to his word and listens?


## Jeremiah 23:19 (id: 924023019)

19See, there is a storm coming from Yahweh! His fury is going out, and a tempest is whirling about. It is whirling around the heads of the wicked.


## Jeremiah 23:20 (id: 924023020)

20Yahweh’s wrath will not return until it has carried out and brought into being his heart’s intentions. In the final days, you will understand it.


## Jeremiah 23:21 (id: 924023021)

21I did not send out these prophets. They just appeared. I did not proclaim anything to them, but they have still prophesied.


## Jeremiah 23:22 (id: 924023022)

22For if they had stood in my council meeting, they would have caused my people to hear my word; they would have caused them to turn from their wicked words and corrupt practices.


## Jeremiah 23:23 (id: 924023023)

23Am I only a God nearby—this is Yahweh’s declaration—and not also a God far away?


## Jeremiah 23:24 (id: 924023024)

24Can anyone hide in a secret place so I cannot see him?—this is Yahweh’s declaration— and do I not fill the heavens and the earth?—this is Yahweh’s declaration.


## Jeremiah 23:25 (id: 924023025)

25I have heard what the prophets have said, those who were prophesying deceit in my name. They said, ‘I had a dream! I had a dream!’


## Jeremiah 23:26 (id: 924023026)

26How long will this go on, prophets who prophesy lies from their minds, and who prophesy from the deceit in their hearts?


## Jeremiah 23:27 (id: 924023027)

27They are planning on making my people forget my name with the dreams that they report, each one to his neighbor, just as their ancestors forgot my name in favor of Baal’s name.


## Jeremiah 23:28 (id: 924023028)

28The prophet who has a dream, let him report the dream. But the one to whom I have declared something, let him declare my word truthfully. What does straw have to do with grain?—this is Yahweh’s declaration—


## Jeremiah 23:29 (id: 924023029)

29Is not my word like fire?—this is Yahweh’s declaration—and like a hammer that shatters a rock into pieces?


## Jeremiah 23:30 (id: 924023030)

30So see, I am against the prophets—this is Yahweh’s declaration—anyone who steals words from another person and says they come from me.


## Jeremiah 23:31 (id: 924023031)

31See, I am against the prophets—this is Yahweh’s declaration—who use their tongues to prophesy proclamations.


## Jeremiah 23:32 (id: 924023032)

32See, I am against the prophets who dream deceitfully—this is Yahweh’s declaration—and then proclaim them and in this way mislead my people with their deceit and boasting. I am against them, for I have not sent them out nor given them commands. So they will certainly not help this people—this is Yahweh’s declaration.


## Jeremiah 23:33 (id: 924023033)

33When these people, or a prophet, or a priest asks you, ‘What is the burden of Yahweh?’ you will say to them, ‘You are the burden, and I will cast you off’—this is Yahweh’s declaration.


## Jeremiah 23:34 (id: 924023034)

34As for the prophets, priests, and people who are saying, ‘This is the burden of Yahweh’ I will punish that man and his house.


## Jeremiah 23:35 (id: 924023035)

35You continue to say, each person to his neighbor and each man to his brother, ‘What did Yahweh answer?’ and ‘What did Yahweh declare?’


## Jeremiah 23:36 (id: 924023036)

36But you must no longer talk about the ‘burden of Yahweh,’ for the burden is every man’s own word, and you have perverted the words of the living God, Yahweh of hosts, our God.


## Jeremiah 23:37 (id: 924023037)

37This is what you will say to the prophet, ‘What answer did Yahweh give you?’ or ‘What did Yahweh say?’


## Jeremiah 23:38 (id: 924023038)

38But if you say, ‘The burden of Yahweh’, this is what Yahweh says: ‘Because you have said these words, ‘The burden of Yahweh,’ when I sent to you, saying, ‘You will not say, “The burden of Yahweh,”’


## Jeremiah 23:39 (id: 924023039)

39therefore, behold, I am about to pick you up and throw you away from me, along with the city that I gave you and your ancestors.


## Jeremiah 23:40 (id: 924023040)

40Then I will put everlasting shame and insult on you that will not be forgotten.’”


## Jeremiah 24:1 (id: 924024001)

1Yahweh showed me something. Behold, two baskets of figs were placed before Yahweh’s temple. (This vision happened after Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, took into exile Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, the officials of Judah, the craftsmen and the metalworkers from Jerusalem and brought them to Babylon.)


## Jeremiah 24:2 (id: 924024002)

2One basket of figs was very good, like first ripe figs, but the other basket of figs was so very bad that they could not be eaten.


## Jeremiah 24:3 (id: 924024003)

3Yahweh said to me, “What do you see, Jeremiah?” I said, “Figs. Figs that are very good and figs that are so very bad they cannot be eaten.”


## Jeremiah 24:4 (id: 924024004)

4Then the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,


## Jeremiah 24:5 (id: 924024005)

5“Yahweh, God of Israel, says this: I will look on the exiles of Judah for their benefit, just like these good figs, the exiles whom I have sent out from this place to the land of Chaldea.


## Jeremiah 24:6 (id: 924024006)

6I will set my eyes on them for good and restore them to this land. I will build them up, and not tear them down. I will plant them, and not uproot them.


## Jeremiah 24:7 (id: 924024007)

7Then I will give them a heart to know me, for I am Yahweh. They will be my people and I will be their God, so they will turn to me with all their heart.


## Jeremiah 24:8 (id: 924024008)

8But like the bad figs that are too bad to be eaten—this is what Yahweh says—I will act in this way with Zedekiah, king of Judah, with his officials, and with the rest of Jerusalem who remain in this land or go to stay in the land of Egypt.


## Jeremiah 24:9 (id: 924024009)

9I will turn them into a frightening thing, a disaster, in the sight of all the kingdoms on earth, a disgrace and a subject for proverbs, taunts, and curses in every place where I will have driven them.


## Jeremiah 24:10 (id: 924024010)

10I will send out sword, famine, and plague against them, until they are destroyed from the land that I gave them and their ancestors.”


## Jeremiah 25:1 (id: 924025001)

1This is the word that came to Jeremiah about all the people of Judah. It came in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah. That was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon.


## Jeremiah 25:2 (id: 924025002)

2Jeremiah the prophet proclaimed this to all the people of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem.


## Jeremiah 25:3 (id: 924025003)

3He said, “For twenty\-three years, from the thirteenth year of Josiah son of Amon, king of Judah until this day, Yahweh’s words have been coming to me and I have spoken to you again and again, but you have not listened.


## Jeremiah 25:4 (id: 924025004)

4Yahweh sent out all his servants the prophets to you again and again, but you have not listened or paid any attention.


## Jeremiah 25:5 (id: 924025005)

5These prophets said, ‘Let each man turn from his wicked way and the corruption of his practices and return to the land that Yahweh gave in ancient times to your ancestors and to you, as a permanent gift.


## Jeremiah 25:6 (id: 924025006)

6So do not walk after other gods to worship them or bow down to them, and do not provoke him with the work of your hands so that he does you harm.’


## Jeremiah 25:7 (id: 924025007)

7But you have not listened to me—this is Yahweh’s declaration—so you have provoked me with the work of your hands to do harm to you.


## Jeremiah 25:8 (id: 924025008)

8So Yahweh of hosts says this, ‘Because you did not listen to my words,


## Jeremiah 25:9 (id: 924025009)

9see, I am about to send out a command to gather all the peoples of the north—this is Yahweh’s declaration—with Nebuchadnezzar my servant, king of Babylon, and bring them against this land and its inhabitants, and against all the nations around you. For I will set them apart for destruction. I will turn them into a horror, an object for hissing, and an unending desolation.


## Jeremiah 25:10 (id: 924025010)

10I will put an end to the sound of joy and sound of gladness, the sound of the groom and the sound of the bride, the sound of the millstones and the light of the lamp.


## Jeremiah 25:11 (id: 924025011)

11Then all of this land will become a desolation and a horror, and these nations will serve the king of Babylon for seventy years.


## Jeremiah 25:12 (id: 924025012)

12Then it will happen when seventy years have been completed, that I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation, the land of the Chaldeans—this is Yahweh’s declaration—for their iniquity and make it an unending desolation.


## Jeremiah 25:13 (id: 924025013)

13Then I will carry out against that land all the words that I had spoken, and everything written in this book that Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations.


## Jeremiah 25:14 (id: 924025014)

14For also many other nations and great kings will make slaves out of these nations. I will repay them for their deeds and the works of their hands.’”


## Jeremiah 25:15 (id: 924025015)

15For Yahweh, God of Israel, said this to me, “Take this cup of the wine of fury from my hand and make all the nations to which I am sending you drink it.


## Jeremiah 25:16 (id: 924025016)

16For they will drink and then stagger about and rant madly before the sword that I am sending out among them.”


## Jeremiah 25:17 (id: 924025017)

17So I took the cup from Yahweh’s hand, and I made all the nations to which Yahweh had sent me drink it:


## Jeremiah 25:18 (id: 924025018)

18Jerusalem, the cities of Judah and her kings and officials—to turn them into ruins and something terrifying, and into an object for hissing and cursing, as they are at this present day.


## Jeremiah 25:19 (id: 924025019)

19Other nations also had to drink it: Pharaoh king of Egypt and his servants; his officials and all his people;


## Jeremiah 25:20 (id: 924025020)

20all people of mixed heritage and all the kings of the land of Uz; all the kings of the land of Philistia—Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod;


## Jeremiah 25:21 (id: 924025021)

21Edom and Moab and the people of Ammon.


## Jeremiah 25:22 (id: 924025022)

22The kings of Tyre and Sidon, the kings of the coasts on the other side of the sea,


## Jeremiah 25:23 (id: 924025023)

23Dedan, Tema, and Buz with all the ones who cut the hair on the sides of their heads, they also had to drink it.


## Jeremiah 25:24 (id: 924025024)

24All the kings of Arabia and all the kings of people of mixed heritage who live in the wilderness;


## Jeremiah 25:25 (id: 924025025)

25all the kings of Zimri, all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes;


## Jeremiah 25:26 (id: 924025026)

26all the kings of the north, the ones close by and the ones far away—everyone with his brother and all the kingdoms of the world that are on the surface of the earth, all of them had to drink the cup from Yahweh’s hand. Finally, the king of Babylon will also drink from that cup.


## Jeremiah 25:27 (id: 924025027)

27Yahweh said to me, “Now you must say to them, ‘Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this: Drink and become drunk, then vomit, fall down, and do not rise before the sword that I am sending among you.’


## Jeremiah 25:28 (id: 924025028)

28Then it will happen that if they refuse to take the cup from your hand to drink, you will say to them, ‘Yahweh of hosts says this: You must certainly drink it.


## Jeremiah 25:29 (id: 924025029)

29For see, I am about to bring disaster on the city that is called by my name, and should you yourselves be free from punishment? You will not be free, for I am calling a sword against all the inhabitants of the land!—this is the declaration of Yahweh of hosts.’


## Jeremiah 25:30 (id: 924025030)

30You must prophesy all these words against them, and say to them, ‘Yahweh will roar from the heights and he will shout with his voice from his holy dwelling, and he will roar mightily against his fold; and he will shout, like those who tread the grapes against all those who live on the earth.


## Jeremiah 25:31 (id: 924025031)

31The sound of battle will resound to the ends of the earth, for Yahweh brings charges against the nations, and he brings judgment on all flesh, and the wicked ones he will put to the sword—this is Yahweh’s declaration.’


## Jeremiah 25:32 (id: 924025032)

32Yahweh of hosts says this, ‘See, disaster is going out from nation to nation, and a great storm is beginning from the farthest parts of the earth.


## Jeremiah 25:33 (id: 924025033)

33Then those killed by Yahweh will on that day extend from one end of the earth to the other; they will not be mourned, gathered, or buried. They will be like dung on the ground.


## Jeremiah 25:34 (id: 924025034)

34Wail, shepherds, and shout for help! Roll about in the dust, you leaders of the flock, for the days of your slaughter have come; you will be scattered when you fall like fine pottery.


## Jeremiah 25:35 (id: 924025035)

35There is no refuge for the shepherds, there will be no escape for the leaders of the flock.


## Jeremiah 25:36 (id: 924025036)

36Hear the cries of the shepherds and the wails of the leaders of the flock, for Yahweh is destroying their pastures.


## Jeremiah 25:37 (id: 924025037)

37So the peaceful pastures will be devastated because of Yahweh’s fierce anger.


## Jeremiah 25:38 (id: 924025038)

38Like a young lion, he has left his den, for their land will become a horror because of the oppressor’s anger, because of his angry wrath.’”


## Jeremiah 26:1 (id: 924026001)

1In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, this word came from Yahweh, saying,


## Jeremiah 26:2 (id: 924026002)

2“Yahweh says this: Stand in the courtyard of my house and speak about all the cities of Judah who come to worship at my house. Proclaim all the words that I have commanded you to say to them. Do not cut short any word!


## Jeremiah 26:3 (id: 924026003)

3It may be that they will listen, that each man will turn from his wicked ways, so I will relent concerning the disaster that I am planning to bring on them because of the wickedness of their practices.


## Jeremiah 26:4 (id: 924026004)

4So you must say to them, ‘Yahweh says this: If you do not listen to me so as to walk in my law that I have placed before you—


## Jeremiah 26:5 (id: 924026005)

5if you do not listen to the words of my servants the prophets whom I am persistently sending to you—but you have not listened!—


## Jeremiah 26:6 (id: 924026006)

6then I will make this house like Shiloh; I will turn this city into a curse in the sight of all the nations on earth.’”


## Jeremiah 26:7 (id: 924026007)

7The priests, the prophets, and all the people heard Jeremiah announcing these words in Yahweh’s house.


## Jeremiah 26:8 (id: 924026008)

8So it happened that when Jeremiah had finished announcing all that Yahweh commanded him to say to all the people, the priests, prophets, and all the people seized him and said, “You will certainly die!


## Jeremiah 26:9 (id: 924026009)

9Why have you prophesied in Yahweh’s name and said that this house will become like Shiloh and this city will become desolate, with no inhabitant?” For all the people had formed a mob against Jeremiah in Yahweh’s house.


## Jeremiah 26:10 (id: 924026010)

10Then the officials of Judah heard these words and went up from the king’s house to Yahweh’s house. They sat in the gateway at the New Gate of Yahweh’s house.


## Jeremiah 26:11 (id: 924026011)

11The priests and the prophets spoke to the officials and to all the people. They said, “It is right for this man to die, for he prophesied against this city, just as you heard with your own ears!”


## Jeremiah 26:12 (id: 924026012)

12So Jeremiah spoke to all the officials and all the people and said, “Yahweh has sent me out to prophesy against this house and this city, to say all the words that you have heard.


## Jeremiah 26:13 (id: 924026013)

13So now, improve your ways and your practices, and listen to the voice of Yahweh your God so that he will relent concerning the disaster that he has proclaimed against you.


## Jeremiah 26:14 (id: 924026014)

14I myself—look at me!—am in your hand. Do to me what is good and right in your eyes.


## Jeremiah 26:15 (id: 924026015)

15But you must surely know that if you kill me, then you are bringing innocent blood on yourselves and on this city and its inhabitants, for Yahweh has truly sent me to you to proclaim all these words for your ears.”


## Jeremiah 26:16 (id: 924026016)

16Then the officials and all the people said to the priests and prophets, “It is not right for this man to die, for he has proclaimed things to us in the name of Yahweh our God.”


## Jeremiah 26:17 (id: 924026017)

17Then men from the elders of the land rose up and spoke to the entire assembly of the people.


## Jeremiah 26:18 (id: 924026018)

18They said, “Micah the Morashite was prophesying in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah. He spoke to all the people of Judah and said, ‘Yahweh of hosts says this: Zion will become a plowed field, Jerusalem will become a heap of rubble, and the hill of the temple will become a thicket.’


## Jeremiah 26:19 (id: 924026019)

19Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all of Judah put him to death? Did he not fear Yahweh and appease the face of Yahweh so that Yahweh would relent concerning the disaster that he proclaimed to them? So will we do greater evil against our own lives?”


## Jeremiah 26:20 (id: 924026020)

20Meanwhile there was another man who prophesied in the name of Yahweh—Uriah son of Shemaiah from Kiriath Jearim—he also prophesied against this city and this land, agreeing with all of Jeremiah’s words.


## Jeremiah 26:21 (id: 924026021)

21But when King Jehoiakim and all his soldiers and officials heard his word, then the king tried to put him to death, but Uriah heard and was afraid, so he ran away and went to Egypt.


## Jeremiah 26:22 (id: 924026022)

22Then King Jehoiakim sent out men to go to Egypt—Elnathan son of Akbor and men to go into Egypt after Uriah.


## Jeremiah 26:23 (id: 924026023)

23They took Uriah out from Egypt and brought him to King Jehoiakim. Then Jehoiakim killed him with a sword and sent his corpse out to the graves of the ordinary people.


## Jeremiah 26:24 (id: 924026024)

24But the hand of Ahikam son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, so he was not given into the hand of the people to be put to death.


## Jeremiah 27:1 (id: 924027001)

1In the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh.


## Jeremiah 27:2 (id: 924027002)

2This is what Yahweh said to me, “Make fetters and a yoke for yourself. Place them on your neck.


## Jeremiah 27:3 (id: 924027003)

3Then send them out to the king of Edom, the king of Moab, the king of the people of Ammon, the king of Tyre, and to the king of Sidon. Send them by the hand of those kings’ ambassadors who have come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah.


## Jeremiah 27:4 (id: 924027004)

4Give commands to them for their masters and say, ‘Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this: This is what you must say to your masters,


## Jeremiah 27:5 (id: 924027005)

5“I myself made the earth by my great strength and my raised arm. I also made the people and animals on the earth, and I give it to anyone who is right in my eyes.


## Jeremiah 27:6 (id: 924027006)

6So now, I myself am giving all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, my servant. Also, I am giving the living things in the fields to him to serve him.


## Jeremiah 27:7 (id: 924027007)

7For all the nations will serve him, his son, and his grandson until the time for his land comes. Then many nations and great kings will subdue him.


## Jeremiah 27:8 (id: 924027008)

8So the nation and the kingdom that does not serve Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and that does not put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon—I will punish that nation with the sword, with famine, and with the plague—this is Yahweh’s declaration—until I have destroyed it by his hand.


## Jeremiah 27:9 (id: 924027009)

9So do not listen to your prophets, your diviners, your seers, your soothsayers, and sorcerers, who have been speaking to you and saying, ‘Do not serve the king of Babylon.’


## Jeremiah 27:10 (id: 924027010)

10For they are prophesying deceit to you in order to send you far away from your lands, for I will drive you away, and you will die.


## Jeremiah 27:11 (id: 924027011)

11But the nation that places its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serves him, I will allow it to rest in its land—this is Yahweh’s declaration—and they will cultivate it and make their homes in it.”’”


## Jeremiah 27:12 (id: 924027012)

12So I spoke to Zedekiah king of Judah and gave him this message, “Place your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him and his people, and you will live.


## Jeremiah 27:13 (id: 924027013)

13Why will you die—you and your people—by the sword, famine, and plague, just as I have declared about the nation that refuses to serve the king of Babylon?


## Jeremiah 27:14 (id: 924027014)

14Do not listen to the words of the prophets who speak to you and say, ‘Do not serve the king of Babylon,’ for they are prophesying lies to you.


## Jeremiah 27:15 (id: 924027015)

15‘For I have not sent them out—this is Yahweh’s declaration—for they are prophesying deceit in my name so that I will drive you out and you will perish, both you and the prophets who are prophesying to you.’”


## Jeremiah 27:16 (id: 924027016)

16I proclaimed this to the priests and all the people and said, “Yahweh says this: Do not listen to the words of your prophets who prophesy to you and say, ‘Look! The objects belonging to Yahweh’s house are being returned from Babylon now!’ They are prophesying lies to you.


## Jeremiah 27:17 (id: 924027017)

17Do not listen to them. You should serve the king of Babylon and live. Why should this city become a ruin?


## Jeremiah 27:18 (id: 924027018)

18If they are prophets, and if the word of Yahweh has truly come to them, let them beg Yahweh of hosts not to send to Babylon the objects that remain in his house, the house of the king of Judah, and Jerusalem.


## Jeremiah 27:19 (id: 924027019)

19Yahweh of hosts says this about the pillars, the large basin known as “The Sea” and its base, and the rest of the objects that remain in this city—


## Jeremiah 27:20 (id: 924027020)

20the objects that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take when he carried Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon with all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem.


## Jeremiah 27:21 (id: 924027021)

21Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this about the objects that remain in the house of Yahweh, the house of the king of Judah, and Jerusalem,


## Jeremiah 27:22 (id: 924027022)

22‘They will be brought to Babylon, and they will remain there until the day I have set to come for them—this is Yahweh’s declaration—then I will bring them up and restore them to this place.’”


## Jeremiah 28:1 (id: 924028001)

1It happened in that year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year and the fifth month, Hananiah son of Azzur the prophet, who was from Gibeon, spoke to me in Yahweh’s house in front of the priests and all the people. He said,


## Jeremiah 28:2 (id: 924028002)

2“Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this: I have broken the yoke imposed by the king of Babylon.


## Jeremiah 28:3 (id: 924028003)

3Within two years I will bring back to this place all the objects belonging to Yahweh’s house that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took from this place and transported to Babylon.


## Jeremiah 28:4 (id: 924028004)

4Then I will bring back to this place Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and all the captives of Judah who were sent to Babylon—this is Yahweh’s declaration—for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.”


## Jeremiah 28:5 (id: 924028005)

5So Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Hananiah the prophet in front of the priests and to all the people who stood in Yahweh’s house.


## Jeremiah 28:6 (id: 924028006)

6Jeremiah the prophet said, “May Yahweh do this! May Yahweh confirm the words that you prophesied and bring back to this place the objects belonging to Yahweh’s house, and all the captives from Babylon.


## Jeremiah 28:7 (id: 924028007)

7However, listen to the word that I am proclaiming in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people.


## Jeremiah 28:8 (id: 924028008)

8The prophets who existed before me and you from long ago also prophesied about many nations and against great kingdoms, about war, famine , and plague.


## Jeremiah 28:9 (id: 924028009)

9So the prophet who prophesies that there will be peace—if his word comes true, then it will be known that he is indeed a prophet sent out by Yahweh.”


## Jeremiah 28:10 (id: 924028010)

10But Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from the neck of Jeremiah the prophet and broke it.


## Jeremiah 28:11 (id: 924028011)

11Then Hananiah spoke in front of all the people and said, “Yahweh says this: Just like this, within two years I will break from off the neck of every nation the yoke imposed by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.” Then Jeremiah the prophet went on his way.


## Jeremiah 28:12 (id: 924028012)

12After Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from the neck of Jeremiah the prophet, the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, saying,


## Jeremiah 28:13 (id: 924028013)

13“Go and speak to Hananiah and say, ‘Yahweh says this: You broke a yoke of wood, but I will make instead a yoke of iron.’


## Jeremiah 28:14 (id: 924028014)

14For Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this: I have placed a yoke of iron on the neck of all of these nations to serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and they will serve him. I have also given him the wild beasts in the fields to rule over.”


## Jeremiah 28:15 (id: 924028015)

15Next Jeremiah the prophet said to Hananiah the prophet, “Listen Hananiah! Yahweh has not sent you, but you yourself have caused this people to believe in lies.


## Jeremiah 28:16 (id: 924028016)

16So Yahweh says this: Look, I am about to send you out from the earth. You will die this year, since you proclaimed rebellion against Yahweh.”


## Jeremiah 28:17 (id: 924028017)

17In the seventh month of that same year, Hananiah the prophet died.


## Jeremiah 29:1 (id: 924029001)

1These are the words in the scroll that Jeremiah the prophet sent out from Jerusalem to the remaining elders among the captives and to the priests, prophets, and all the people that Nebuchadnezzar exiled from Jerusalem to Babylon.


## Jeremiah 29:2 (id: 924029002)

2This was after Jehoiachin the king, the queen mother, and the high officials, the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, and the craftsmen had been sent away from Jerusalem.


## Jeremiah 29:3 (id: 924029003)

3He sent this scroll by the hand of Elasah son of Shapan and Gemariah son of Hilkiah whom Zedekiah, king of Judah, had sent to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.


## Jeremiah 29:4 (id: 924029004)

4The scroll said, “Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this to all the captives whom I caused to be exiled from Jerusalem to Babylon,


## Jeremiah 29:5 (id: 924029005)

5‘Build houses and live in them. Plant gardens and eat their fruit.


## Jeremiah 29:6 (id: 924029006)

6Take wives and give birth to sons and daughters. Then take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands. Let them give birth to sons and daughters and increase there so you do not become too few.


## Jeremiah 29:7 (id: 924029007)

7Seek the peace of the city where I have caused you to be exiled, and intercede with me on its behalf since there will be peace for you if it is at peace.’


## Jeremiah 29:8 (id: 924029008)

8For Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this, ‘Do not let your prophets who are in your midst and your diviners deceive you, and do not listen to the dreams that you yourselves are having.


## Jeremiah 29:9 (id: 924029009)

9For they are prophesying deceitfully to you in my name. I did not send them—this is Yahweh’s declaration.’


## Jeremiah 29:10 (id: 924029010)

10For Yahweh says this, ‘When Babylon has ruled you for seventy years, I will help you and carry out my good word for you to bring you back to this place.


## Jeremiah 29:11 (id: 924029011)

11For I myself know the plans that I have for you—this is Yahweh’s declaration—plans for peace and not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope.


## Jeremiah 29:12 (id: 924029012)

12Then you will call to me, and go and pray to me, and I will listen to you.


## Jeremiah 29:13 (id: 924029013)

13For you will seek me and find me, since you will seek me with all your heart.


## Jeremiah 29:14 (id: 924029014)

14Then I will be found by you—this is Yahweh’s declaration—and I will bring back your fortunes; I will gather you from all the nations and places where I scattered you—this is Yahweh’s declaration—for I will bring you back to the place from where I caused you to be exiled.’


## Jeremiah 29:15 (id: 924029015)

15Since you said that Yahweh has raised up prophets for us in Babylon,


## Jeremiah 29:16 (id: 924029016)

16Yahweh says this to the king who sits on the throne of David and to all the people who are staying in that city, your brothers who have not gone out with you into captivity—


## Jeremiah 29:17 (id: 924029017)

17Yahweh of hosts says this, ‘See, I am about to send sword, famine, and disease on them. For I will make them like rotten figs that are too bad to be eaten.


## Jeremiah 29:18 (id: 924029018)

18Then I will pursue them with sword, famine, and plague and make them a horrible sight to all the kingdoms on earth—a horror, an object of curses and hissing, and a shameful thing among all the nations where I scattered her.


## Jeremiah 29:19 (id: 924029019)

19This is because they did not listen to my word—this is Yahweh’s declaration—that I sent out to them through my servants the prophets. I repeatedly sent them, but you would not listen—this is Yahweh’s declaration.’


## Jeremiah 29:20 (id: 924029020)

20So you yourselves listen to the word of Yahweh, all you exiles whom he has sent out from Jerusalem to Babylon,


## Jeremiah 29:21 (id: 924029021)

21‘Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this about Ahab son of Kolaiah and Zedekiah son of Maaseiah, who prophesy falsely to you in my name: See, I am about to put them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. He will kill them before your eyes.


## Jeremiah 29:22 (id: 924029022)

22Then a curse will be spoken about these persons by all the captives of Judah in Babylon. The curse will say: May Yahweh make you like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in fire.


## Jeremiah 29:23 (id: 924029023)

23This will happen because of the shameful things they did in Israel when they committed adultery with their neighbor’s wives and declared false words in my name, things that I never commanded them to say. For I am the one who knows; I am the witness—this is Yahweh’s declaration.’”


## Jeremiah 29:24 (id: 924029024)

24“About Shemaiah the Nehelamite, say this:


## Jeremiah 29:25 (id: 924029025)

25‘Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this: Because you sent out letters in your own name to all the people in Jerusalem, to Zephaniah son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, and said,


## Jeremiah 29:26 (id: 924029026)

26“Yahweh has made you priest instead of Jehoiada the priest, for you to be in charge of Yahweh’s house. You are in control of all the people who rave and make themselves into prophets. You should put them in stocks and chains.


## Jeremiah 29:27 (id: 924029027)

27So now, why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth, who makes himself into a prophet against you?


## Jeremiah 29:28 (id: 924029028)

28For he has sent to us in Babylon and said, ‘It will be a long time. Build houses and live in them, and plant gardens and eat their fruit.”’”


## Jeremiah 29:29 (id: 924029029)

29Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the hearing of Jeremiah the prophet.


## Jeremiah 29:30 (id: 924029030)

30Then the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, saying,


## Jeremiah 29:31 (id: 924029031)

31“Send word to all the exiles and say, ‘Yahweh says this about Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you when I myself did not send him, and he has led you to believe lies,


## Jeremiah 29:32 (id: 924029032)

32therefore Yahweh says this: Look, I am about to punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his descendants. There will not be a man for him to stay among this people. He will not see the good that I will do for my people—this is Yahweh’s declaration—for he has proclaimed rebellion against Yahweh.’”


## Jeremiah 30:1 (id: 924030001)

1The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,


## Jeremiah 30:2 (id: 924030002)

2“This is what Yahweh, God of Israel, says, ‘Write in a scroll all the words that I have spoken to you.


## Jeremiah 30:3 (id: 924030003)

3For look, days are coming—this is Yahweh’s declaration—when I will restore the fortunes of my people, Israel and Judah. I, Yahweh, have said it. For I will bring them back to the land that I gave their ancestors, and they will possess it.’”


## Jeremiah 30:4 (id: 924030004)

4These are the words that Yahweh declared concerning Israel and Judah,


## Jeremiah 30:5 (id: 924030005)

5“For Yahweh says this, ‘We have heard a trembling voice of dread and not of peace.


## Jeremiah 30:6 (id: 924030006)

6Ask and see if a man bears a child. Why do I see every young man with his hand on his loins like a woman bearing a child? Why have all their faces become pale?


## Jeremiah 30:7 (id: 924030007)

7Woe! For that day will be great, with none like it. It will be a time of anxiety for Jacob, but he will be rescued from it.


## Jeremiah 30:8 (id: 924030008)

8For it will be in that day—this is the declaration of Yahweh of hosts—that I will break the yoke off your neck, and I will shatter your chains, so foreigners will no longer enslave you.


## Jeremiah 30:9 (id: 924030009)

9But they will worship Yahweh their God and serve David their king, whom I will make king over them.


## Jeremiah 30:10 (id: 924030010)

10So you, my servant Jacob, do not fear—this is Yahweh’s declaration—and do not be dismayed, Israel. For see, I am about to bring you back from far away, and your descendants from the land of captivity. Jacob will return and be at peace; he will be secure, and there will be no more terror.


## Jeremiah 30:11 (id: 924030011)

11For I am with you—this is Yahweh’s declaration—to save you. Then I will bring a complete end to all the nations where I have scattered you. But I will certainly not put an end to you, though I discipline you justly and will certainly not leave you unpunished.’


## Jeremiah 30:12 (id: 924030012)

12For Yahweh says this, ‘Your injury is incurable; your wound is infected.


## Jeremiah 30:13 (id: 924030013)

13There is no one to plead your case; there is no remedy for your wound to heal you.


## Jeremiah 30:14 (id: 924030014)

14All of your lovers have forgotten you. They will not look for you, for I have wounded you with the wound of an enemy and the discipline of a cruel master because of your many iniquities and your innumerable sins.


## Jeremiah 30:15 (id: 924030015)

15Why do you call for help for your injury? Your pain is incurable. Because of your many iniquities, your innumerable sins, I have done these things to you.


## Jeremiah 30:16 (id: 924030016)

16So everyone who consumes you will be consumed, and all of your adversaries will go into captivity. For the ones who have plundered you will become plunder, and I will make all of the ones despoiling you a spoil.


## Jeremiah 30:17 (id: 924030017)

17For I will bring healing on you; I will heal you of your wounds—this is Yahweh’s declaration— I will do this because they called you: Outcast. No one cares for this Zion.’”


## Jeremiah 30:18 (id: 924030018)

18Yahweh says this, “See, I am about to bring back the fortunes of Jacob’s tents and have compassion on his homes. Then a city will be built on the heap of ruins, and a stronghold will exist again where it used to be.


## Jeremiah 30:19 (id: 924030019)

19Then a song of praise and a sound of merriment will go out from them, for I will increase them and not diminish them; I will honor them so they will not be humbled.


## Jeremiah 30:20 (id: 924030020)

20Then their people will be like before, and their assembly will be established before me when I punish all the ones who are now tormenting them.


## Jeremiah 30:21 (id: 924030021)

21Their leader will come from among them. He will emerge from their midst when I draw him near and when he approaches me. If I do not do this, who would dare come close to me?—this is Yahweh’s declaration.


## Jeremiah 30:22 (id: 924030022)

22Then you will be my people, and I will be your God.


## Jeremiah 30:23 (id: 924030023)

23See, the tempest of Yahweh, his fury, has gone out. It is a continual tempest. It will whirl on the heads of the wicked people.


## Jeremiah 30:24 (id: 924030024)

24Yahweh’s wrath will not return until it has carried out and brought into being his heart’s intentions. In the final days, you will understand it.”


## Jeremiah 31:1 (id: 924031001)

1“At that time—this is Yahweh’s declaration—I will be the God of all the clans of Israel, and they will be my people.”


## Jeremiah 31:2 (id: 924031002)

2Yahweh says this, “The people who have survived the sword have found favor in the wilderness; I will go out to give rest to Israel.”


## Jeremiah 31:3 (id: 924031003)

3Yahweh appeared to me in the past and said, “I have loved you, Israel, with everlasting love. So I have drawn you toward myself with covenant faithfulness.


## Jeremiah 31:4 (id: 924031004)

4I will build you up again so you will be built, virgin Israel. You will again pick up your tambourines and go out with happy dances.


## Jeremiah 31:5 (id: 924031005)

5You will plant vineyards again on the mountains of Samaria; the farmers will plant and put the fruit to good use.


## Jeremiah 31:6 (id: 924031006)

6For a day will come when the watchmen in the mountains of Ephraim will proclaim, ‘Arise, let us go up to Zion to Yahweh our God.’


## Jeremiah 31:7 (id: 924031007)

7For Yahweh says this, “Shout for joy over Jacob! Shout in gladness for the chief people of the nations! Let praise be heard. Say, ‘Yahweh has rescued his people, the remnant of Israel.’


## Jeremiah 31:8 (id: 924031008)

8See, I am about to bring them from the northern lands. I will gather them from the farthest parts of the earth. The blind and lame will be among them; pregnant women and those who are about to give birth will be with them. A great assembly will return here.


## Jeremiah 31:9 (id: 924031009)

9They will come weeping; I will lead them as they make their pleas. I will have them journey to streams of water on a straight road. They will not stumble on it, for I will be a father to Israel, and Ephraim will be my firstborn.”


## Jeremiah 31:10 (id: 924031010)

10“Hear the word of Yahweh, nations. Report along the coasts in the distance. You nations must say, ‘The one who scattered Israel is gathering her up and keeping her as a shepherd keeps his sheep.’


## Jeremiah 31:11 (id: 924031011)

11For Yahweh has ransomed Jacob and has redeemed him from the hand that was too strong for him.


## Jeremiah 31:12 (id: 924031012)

12Then they will come and rejoice on the heights of Zion. Their faces will shine because of Yahweh’s goodness, over the corn and the new wine, over the oil and the offspring of the flocks and herds. For their lives will become like a watered garden, and they will never again feel any more sorrow.


## Jeremiah 31:13 (id: 924031013)

13Then virgins will rejoice with dancing, and young and old men will be together. For I will change their mourning into celebration. I will have compassion on them and cause them to rejoice instead of sorrowing.


## Jeremiah 31:14 (id: 924031014)

14Then I will saturate the lives of the priests in abundance. My people will fill themselves with my goodness—this is Yahweh’s declaration.”


## Jeremiah 31:15 (id: 924031015)

15Yahweh says this: “A voice is heard in Ramah, wailing and bitter weeping. It is Rachel weeping for her children. She refuses to be comforted over them, for they live no longer.”


## Jeremiah 31:16 (id: 924031016)

16Yahweh says this, “Hold your voice back from weeping and your eyes from tears; there is a reward for your work—this is Yahweh’s declaration—your children will return from the land of the enemy.


## Jeremiah 31:17 (id: 924031017)

17There is hope for your future—this is Yahweh’s declaration—your descendants will return inside their borders.”


## Jeremiah 31:18 (id: 924031018)

18“I have certainly heard Ephraim sorrowing, ‘You punished me, and I have been punished like an untrained calf. Bring me back and I will be brought back, for you are Yahweh my God.


## Jeremiah 31:19 (id: 924031019)

19For after I turned back to you, I was sorry; after I was trained, I slapped my thigh. I was ashamed and humiliated, for I have borne the guilt of my youth.’


## Jeremiah 31:20 (id: 924031020)

20Is not Ephraim my precious child? Is he not my dear, delightful son? For whenever I speak against him, I certainly still call him to my loving mind. In this way my heart longs for him. I will certainly have compassion on him—this is Yahweh’s declaration.”


## Jeremiah 31:21 (id: 924031021)

21Place road signs for yourself. Set up guideposts for yourself. Set your mind on the right path, the way you should take. Come back, virgin Israel! Come back to these cities of yours.


## Jeremiah 31:22 (id: 924031022)

22How long will you waver, faithless daughter? For Yahweh has created something new on earth—a woman surrounds a strong man.


## Jeremiah 31:23 (id: 924031023)

23Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, says this, “When I bring back the people to their land, they will say this in the land of Judah and its cities, ‘May Yahweh bless you, you righteous place where he lives, you holy mountain.’


## Jeremiah 31:24 (id: 924031024)

24For Judah and all its cities will live together there, as will farmers and those who set out with flocks.


## Jeremiah 31:25 (id: 924031025)

25For I will cause those who are weary to drink, and I fill up those who are faint.”


## Jeremiah 31:26 (id: 924031026)

26After this I awoke, and I realized that my sleep had been refreshing.


## Jeremiah 31:27 (id: 924031027)

27“Look, the days are coming—this is Yahweh’s declaration—when I will sow the houses of Israel and Judah with the descendants of man and beast.


## Jeremiah 31:28 (id: 924031028)

28In the past, I kept them under surveillance in order to uproot them and to tear them down, to overthrow, destroy, and bring them harm. But in the coming days, I will watch over them, in order to build them up and to plant them—this is Yahweh’s declaration.


## Jeremiah 31:29 (id: 924031029)

29In those days no one will say any longer, ‘Fathers have eaten sour grapes, but the children’s teeth are dulled.’


## Jeremiah 31:30 (id: 924031030)

30For each man will die in his own iniquity; everyone who eats sour grapes, his teeth will be dulled.


## Jeremiah 31:31 (id: 924031031)

31Look, the days are coming— this is Yahweh’s declaration— when I will establish a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah.


## Jeremiah 31:32 (id: 924031032)

32It will not be like the covenant that I established with their fathers in the days when I took them by their hand to bring them out from the land of Egypt, because they broke my covenant, although I was a husband for them— this is Yahweh’s declaration.


## Jeremiah 31:33 (id: 924031033)

33This is the covenant that I will establish with the house of Israel after these days —this is Yahweh’s declaration. I will place my law within them and will write it on their heart, for I will be their God, and they will be my people.


## Jeremiah 31:34 (id: 924031034)

34Then each man will no longer teach his neighbor, or a man teach his brother and say, ‘Know Yahweh!’ For all of them will know me, from the smallest of them to the greatest —this is Yahweh’s declaration— for I will forgive their iniquity and will no longer call their sins to mind.”


## Jeremiah 31:35 (id: 924031035)

35Yahweh says this, it is he who makes the sun to shine by day and fixes the moon and stars to shine by night. He is the one who sets the sea in motion so that its waves roar— Yahweh of hosts is his name.


## Jeremiah 31:36 (id: 924031036)

36“Only if these permanent things vanish from my sight—this is Yahweh’s declaration— will Israel’s descendants ever stop from forever being a nation before me.”


## Jeremiah 31:37 (id: 924031037)

37Yahweh says this, “Only if the highest heavens can be measured, and only if the earth’s foundation below can be discovered, will I reject all of Israel’s descendants because of all that they have done—this is Yahweh’s declaration.”


## Jeremiah 31:38 (id: 924031038)

38“Look, the days are coming—this is Yahweh’s declaration—when the city will be rebuilt for me, from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate.


## Jeremiah 31:39 (id: 924031039)

39Then the measuring line will go out again farther, to the hill of Gareb and around Goah.


## Jeremiah 31:40 (id: 924031040)

40The whole valley of the dead bodies and the ashes, and all the terraced fields going out to the Kidron Valley as far as the corner of the Horse Gate on the east, will be set apart for Yahweh. The city will not be pulled up or overthrown again, forever.”


## Jeremiah 32:1 (id: 924032001)

1This is the word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar.


## Jeremiah 32:2 (id: 924032002)

2At that time, the army of the king of Babylon was besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was imprisoned in the courtyard of the guard at the house of the king of Judah.


## Jeremiah 32:3 (id: 924032003)

3Zedekiah king of Judah had imprisoned him and said, “Why do you prophesy and say, ‘Yahweh says this: Look, I am about to give over this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will capture it.


## Jeremiah 32:4 (id: 924032004)

4Zedekiah king of Judah will not escape from the hand of the Chaldeans, for he will certainly be given into the hand of the king of Babylon. His mouth will speak to the king’s mouth, and his eyes will see the king’s eyes.


## Jeremiah 32:5 (id: 924032005)

5He will take Zekediah to Babylon, and he will remain there until I have dealt with him—this is Yahweh’s declaration. Though you fight against the Chaldeans, you will not succeed.’”


## Jeremiah 32:6 (id: 924032006)

6Jeremiah said, “The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,


## Jeremiah 32:7 (id: 924032007)

7‘Look, Hanamel son of Shallum your uncle is coming to you and will say, “Buy my field that is in Anathoth for yourself, for the right to buy it belongs to you.”’”


## Jeremiah 32:8 (id: 924032008)

8Then, as Yahweh had declared, Hanamel, the son of my uncle, came to me in the courtyard of the guard, and he said to me, “Buy my field that is in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin, for the right of inheritance is yours, and the right to buy it belongs to you. Buy it for yourself.” Then I knew that this was Yahweh’s word.


## Jeremiah 32:9 (id: 924032009)

9So I bought the field in Anathoth from Hanamel, the son of my uncle, and I weighed out for him the silver, seventeen shekels in weight.


## Jeremiah 32:10 (id: 924032010)

10Then I wrote in a scroll and sealed it, and had witnesses witness it. Then I weighed the silver in the scales.


## Jeremiah 32:11 (id: 924032011)

11Next I took the deed of purchase that was sealed, following the command and the statutes, as well as the unsealed deed.


## Jeremiah 32:12 (id: 924032012)

12I gave the sealed scroll to Baruch son of Neriah son of Mahseiah in front of Hanamel, the son of my uncle, and the witnesses who had written in the sealed scroll, and in front of all the Judeans who sat in the courtyard of the guard.


## Jeremiah 32:13 (id: 924032013)

13So I gave a command to Baruch before them. I said,


## Jeremiah 32:14 (id: 924032014)

14“Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this: Take these documents, both this receipt of purchase that is sealed and the unsealed copies of the deed of purchase, and put them in a clay jar so they will last for a long time.


## Jeremiah 32:15 (id: 924032015)

15For Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this: Houses, fields, and vineyards will again be bought in this land.”


## Jeremiah 32:16 (id: 924032016)

16After I gave the receipt of purchase to Baruch son of Neriah, I prayed to Yahweh and said,


## Jeremiah 32:17 (id: 924032017)

17“Woe, Lord Yahweh! Look! You alone have made the heavens and the earth by your great strength and with your raised arm. Nothing you say is too difficult for you to do.


## Jeremiah 32:18 (id: 924032018)

18You show covenant faithfulness to thousands and pour the guilt of men into the laps of their children after them. You are the great and mighty God; Yahweh of hosts is your name.


## Jeremiah 32:19 (id: 924032019)

19You are great in wisdom and mighty in deeds, for your eyes are open to all the ways of people, to give to each man what his conduct and deeds deserve.


## Jeremiah 32:20 (id: 924032020)

20You did signs and wonders in the land of Egypt. To this present day here in Israel and among all mankind, you have made your name famous.


## Jeremiah 32:21 (id: 924032021)

21For you brought your people Israel out from the land of Egypt with signs and wonders, with a strong hand, with a raised arm, and with great terror.


## Jeremiah 32:22 (id: 924032022)

22Then you gave them this land—which you had sworn to their ancestors to give to them—a land flowing with milk and honey.


## Jeremiah 32:23 (id: 924032023)

23So they entered and took possession of it. But they did not obey your voice or live in obedience to your law. They did nothing of what you had commanded them to do, so you brought all this disaster on them.


## Jeremiah 32:24 (id: 924032024)

24Look! The siege mounds have reached up to the city to capture it. For because of sword, famine, and plague, the city has been given into the hand of the Chaldeans who are fighting against it. For what you have said would happen is happening, and see, you are watching.


## Jeremiah 32:25 (id: 924032025)

25Then you yourself said to me, ‘Purchase a field for yourself with silver and have witnesses witness it, even though this city is being given into the hand of the Chaldeans.’”


## Jeremiah 32:26 (id: 924032026)

26The word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, saying,


## Jeremiah 32:27 (id: 924032027)

27“Look! I am Yahweh, God of all mankind. Is anything too difficult for me to do?


## Jeremiah 32:28 (id: 924032028)

28Therefore Yahweh says this, ‘See, I am about to give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans and Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon. He will capture it.


## Jeremiah 32:29 (id: 924032029)

29The Chaldeans who are fighting against this city will come and set fire to this city and burn it, along with the houses on the roofs of which the people worshiped Baal and poured out drink offerings to other gods in order to provoke me.


## Jeremiah 32:30 (id: 924032030)

30For the people of Israel and Judah have certainly been people who have been doing evil before my eyes since their youth. The people of Israel have certainly offended me with the practices of their hands—this is Yahweh’s declaration.


## Jeremiah 32:31 (id: 924032031)

31Yahweh declares that this city has been a provocation of my wrath and fury since the day that they built it. It has been that right up to this present day. So I will remove it from before my face


## Jeremiah 32:32 (id: 924032032)

32because of all the wickedness of the people of Israel and Judah, the things that they have done to provoke me—they, their kings, princes, priests, prophets, and every person in Judah and inhabitant of Jerusalem.


## Jeremiah 32:33 (id: 924032033)

33They turned their backs to me instead of their faces, though I had eagerly taught them. I tried to teach them, but not one of them listened in order to receive correction.


## Jeremiah 32:34 (id: 924032034)

34They set up their abominable idols in the house that is called by my name, to defile it.


## Jeremiah 32:35 (id: 924032035)

35They built high places for Baal in the Valley of Ben Hinnom in order to put their sons and daughters in the fire for Molech. I did not command them. It never entered my mind that they should do this detestable thing and so cause Judah to sin.’


## Jeremiah 32:36 (id: 924032036)

36So now therefore, I, Yahweh, the God of Israel, say this concerning this city, the city about which you are saying, ‘It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by sword, famine, and plague.’


## Jeremiah 32:37 (id: 924032037)

37See, I am about to gather them from every land where I had driven them in my wrath, fury, and great anger. I am about to bring them back to this place and enable them to live in security.


## Jeremiah 32:38 (id: 924032038)

38Then they will be my people, and I will be their God.


## Jeremiah 32:39 (id: 924032039)

39I will give them one heart and one way to honor me every day so it will be good for them and their descendants after them.


## Jeremiah 32:40 (id: 924032040)

40Then I will make with them an everlasting covenant, that I will not turn away from doing good to them. I will set honor for me in their hearts, so that they will never turn away from me.


## Jeremiah 32:41 (id: 924032041)

41Then I will rejoice in doing good to them. I will faithfully plant them in this land with all my heart and all my life.


## Jeremiah 32:42 (id: 924032042)

42For Yahweh says this, ‘Just as I have brought all this great disaster on this people, so I will bring on them all the good things that I have said I would do for them.


## Jeremiah 32:43 (id: 924032043)

43Then fields will be bought in this land, about which you are saying, “This is a ruined land, which has neither man nor beast. It has been given into the hand of the Chaldeans.”


## Jeremiah 32:44 (id: 924032044)

44They will buy fields with silver and write in sealed scrolls. They will assemble witnesses in the land of Benjamin, all around Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, in the cities in the hill country and in the lowlands, and in the cities of the Negev. For I will bring back their fortunes—this is Yahweh’s declaration.’”


## Jeremiah 33:1 (id: 924033001)

1Then the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah a second time, while he was still shut within the courtyard of the guard, saying,


## Jeremiah 33:2 (id: 924033002)

2“Yahweh the maker, says this—Yahweh, who forms in order to establish—Yahweh is his name,


## Jeremiah 33:3 (id: 924033003)

3‘Call to me, and I will answer you. I will demonstrate great things to you, mysteries that you do not understand.’


## Jeremiah 33:4 (id: 924033004)

4For Yahweh, God of Israel, says this concerning the houses in this city and the houses of the kings of Judah that are torn down because of the siege ramps and the sword,


## Jeremiah 33:5 (id: 924033005)

5‘The Chaldeans are coming to fight and to fill the houses with corpses of people whom I will kill in my wrath and fury, when I hide my face from this city because of all their wickedness.


## Jeremiah 33:6 (id: 924033006)

6But see, I am about to bring healing and a cure, for I will heal them and will bring to them abundance, peace, and faithfulness.


## Jeremiah 33:7 (id: 924033007)

7For I will bring back the fortunes of Judah and Israel; I will build them up as in the beginning.


## Jeremiah 33:8 (id: 924033008)

8Then I will purify them from all the iniquity that they have committed against me. I will pardon all the iniquities that they have done against me, and all the ways that they rebelled against me.


## Jeremiah 33:9 (id: 924033009)

9For this city will become for me an object of joy, a song of praise and honor for all the nations of the earth who will hear of all the good things that I am going to do for it. Then they will fear and tremble because of all the good things and the peace that I will give to it.’


## Jeremiah 33:10 (id: 924033010)

10Yahweh says this, ‘In this place about which you are now saying, “It is desolate, a place with neither man nor beast,” in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate having neither man nor beast, there will be heard again


## Jeremiah 33:11 (id: 924033011)

11the sound of joy and the sound of gladness, the sound of the groom and the sound of the bride, the sound of those who say, while they bring thank offerings to the house of Yahweh, “Give thanks to Yahweh of hosts, for Yahweh is good, and his unfailing love lasts forever!” For I will restore the fortunes of the land to what they were before,’ says Yahweh.


## Jeremiah 33:12 (id: 924033012)

12Yahweh of hosts says this: ‘In this desolate place, where now there is neither man nor beast—in all its cities there will again be pastures where shepherds can rest their flocks.


## Jeremiah 33:13 (id: 924033013)

13In the cities in the hill country, the lowlands, and the Negev, in the land of Benjamin and all around Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, the flocks will again pass under the hands of the ones counting them,’ says Yahweh.


## Jeremiah 33:14 (id: 924033014)

14‘Look! Days are coming—this is Yahweh’s declaration—when I will do what I have promised for the house of Israel and the house of Judah.


## Jeremiah 33:15 (id: 924033015)

15In those days and in that time I will make a righteous branch to grow for David, and he will carry out justice and righteousness in the land.


## Jeremiah 33:16 (id: 924033016)

16In those days Judah will be saved, and Jerusalem will live in security, for this is what she will be called, “Yahweh is our righteousness.”’


## Jeremiah 33:17 (id: 924033017)

17For Yahweh says this: ‘A man from David’s line will never be lacking to sit on the throne of the house of Israel,


## Jeremiah 33:18 (id: 924033018)

18nor will a man from the Levitical priests be lacking before me to raise burnt offerings, to burn food offerings, and to perform grain offerings all the time.’”


## Jeremiah 33:19 (id: 924033019)

19The word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, saying,


## Jeremiah 33:20 (id: 924033020)

20“Yahweh says this: ‘If you can break my covenant with day and night so that there will no longer be day or night at their proper times,


## Jeremiah 33:21 (id: 924033021)

21then you will be able to break my covenant with David my servant, so that he will no longer have a son to sit on his throne, and my covenant with the Levitical priests, my servants.


## Jeremiah 33:22 (id: 924033022)

22As the hosts of heaven cannot be counted, and as the sand of the seashores cannot be measured, so I will increase the descendants of David my servant and the Levites who serve before me.’”


## Jeremiah 33:23 (id: 924033023)

23The word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, saying,


## Jeremiah 33:24 (id: 924033024)

24“Have you not considered what this people has declared when they said, ‘The two families that Yahweh chose, now he has rejected them’? In this way they despise my people, saying that they are no longer a nation in their sight.


## Jeremiah 33:25 (id: 924033025)

25I, Yahweh, say this, ‘If I have not established the covenant of day and night, and if I have not fixed the laws of heaven and earth,


## Jeremiah 33:26 (id: 924033026)

26then I will reject the descendants of Jacob and David my servant, and not bring from them a person to rule over the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. For I will restore their fortunes and show mercy to them.’”


## Jeremiah 34:1 (id: 924034001)

1The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all of his army, together with all the kingdoms of the earth, the domains under his power, and all their people were waging war against Jerusalem and all of her cities, saying:


## Jeremiah 34:2 (id: 924034002)

2“Yahweh, God of Israel, says this: Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah and say to him, ‘Yahweh says this: Look, I am about to give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon. He will burn it.


## Jeremiah 34:3 (id: 924034003)

3You will not escape from his hand, for you will certainly be seized and given into his hand. Your eyes will look at the eyes of the king of Babylon; he will speak directly to you as you go to Babylon.’


## Jeremiah 34:4 (id: 924034004)

4Listen to the word of Yahweh, Zedekiah king of Judah! Yahweh says this concerning you, ‘You will not die by the sword.


## Jeremiah 34:5 (id: 924034005)

5You will die in peace. As in the funeral burning of your ancestors, the kings who were before you, they will burn your body. They will say, “Woe, master!” They will lament for you. Now I have spoken—this is Yahweh’s declaration.’”


## Jeremiah 34:6 (id: 924034006)

6So Jeremiah the prophet proclaimed to Zedekiah king of Judah all these words in Jerusalem.


## Jeremiah 34:7 (id: 924034007)

7The army of the king of Babylon made war against Jerusalem and all the remaining cities of Judah: Lachish and Azekah. These cities of Judah remained as fortified cities.


## Jeremiah 34:8 (id: 924034008)

8The word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem, to proclaim freedom to them,


## Jeremiah 34:9 (id: 924034009)

9that each man must free his Hebrew slaves, both male and female, so one was to make a slave of a Jew, who was his brother.


## Jeremiah 34:10 (id: 924034010)

10So all the leaders and people entered into the covenant that each person would free his male and female slaves so that they would not be enslaved any longer. They obeyed and set them free.


## Jeremiah 34:11 (id: 924034011)

11But after this they changed their minds. They brought back the slaves whom they had freed. They forced them to become slaves again.


## Jeremiah 34:12 (id: 924034012)

12So the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, saying,


## Jeremiah 34:13 (id: 924034013)

13“Yahweh, God of Israel, says this, ‘I myself made a covenant with your ancestors on the day that I brought them out from the land of Egypt, out from the house of slavery. That was when I said,


## Jeremiah 34:14 (id: 924034014)

14“At the end of every seven years, each man must send away his brother, his fellow Hebrew who had sold himself to you and served you for six years. Send him away in freedom.” But your ancestors did not listen to me or incline their ears to me.


## Jeremiah 34:15 (id: 924034015)

15Now you yourselves repented and began to do what is right in my eyes. You proclaimed freedom, each man to his neighbor, and you made a covenant before me in the house that is called by my name.


## Jeremiah 34:16 (id: 924034016)

16But then you turned and polluted my name; you caused each man to bring back his male and female slaves, the ones whom you had sent out to go where they wished. You forced them to become your slaves again.’


## Jeremiah 34:17 (id: 924034017)

17Therefore Yahweh says this, ‘You yourselves have not listened to me. You should have proclaimed freedom, every one of you, to your brothers and fellow Israelites. So look! I am about to proclaim freedom to you—this is Yahweh’s declaration—freedom for the sword, the plague, and famine, for I am going to make you a horrible thing in the sight of every kingdom on earth.


## Jeremiah 34:18 (id: 924034018)

18Then I will deal with the people who have broken my covenant, who did not keep the words of the covenant that they established before me when they cut a bull in two and walked between its parts,


## Jeremiah 34:19 (id: 924034019)

19and then the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, the eunuchs and the priests, and all the people of the land walked between the parts of the bull.


## Jeremiah 34:20 (id: 924034020)

20I will give them into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those who are seeking their lives. Their bodies will be food for the birds of the skies and the beasts on the earth.


## Jeremiah 34:21 (id: 924034021)

21So I will give Zedekiah king of Judah and his leaders into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those who are seeking their life, and into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon that has risen up against you.


## Jeremiah 34:22 (id: 924034022)

22Look, I am about to give a command—this is Yahweh’s declaration—and will bring them back to this city to wage war against it and take it, and to burn it. For I will turn the cities of Judah into ruined places in which there will be no inhabitants.’”


## Jeremiah 35:1 (id: 924035001)

1The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh in the days of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, saying,


## Jeremiah 35:2 (id: 924035002)

2“Go to the family of the Rekabites and speak with them. Then bring them to my house, into one of the rooms there, and give them wine to drink.”


## Jeremiah 35:3 (id: 924035003)

3So I took Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah son of Habazziniah and his brothers, all his sons, and all the family of the Rekabites.


## Jeremiah 35:4 (id: 924035004)

4I took them to the house of Yahweh, into the rooms of the sons of Hanan son of Igdaliah, the man of God. These rooms were beside the room of the leaders, which was above the room of Maaseiah son of Shallum, the gatekeeper.


## Jeremiah 35:5 (id: 924035005)

5Then I placed bowls and cups full of wine in front of the Rekabites and said to them, “Drink some wine.”


## Jeremiah 35:6 (id: 924035006)

6But they said, “We will not drink any wine, for our ancestor, Jonadab son of Rekab, commanded us, ‘Do not drink any wine, neither you nor your descendants, forever.


## Jeremiah 35:7 (id: 924035007)

7Also, do not build any houses, sow any seeds, or plant any vineyards; this is not for you. For you must live in tents all your days, so that you might live many days in the land where you are staying as foreigners.’


## Jeremiah 35:8 (id: 924035008)

8We have obeyed the voice of Jonadab son of Rekab, our ancestor, in all that he commanded us, to never drink wine all of our days, we, our wives, our sons, and our daughters.


## Jeremiah 35:9 (id: 924035009)

9We will never build houses to live in, and there will be no vineyard, field, or seed in our possession.


## Jeremiah 35:10 (id: 924035010)

10We have lived in tents and we have obeyed and done all that Jonadab our ancestor commanded us.


## Jeremiah 35:11 (id: 924035011)

11But when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon attacked the land, we said, ‘Come, we must go to Jerusalem to escape from the Chaldean and Aramean armies.’ So we are living in Jerusalem.”


## Jeremiah 35:12 (id: 924035012)

12Then the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, saying,


## Jeremiah 35:13 (id: 924035013)

13“Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this, ‘Go and say to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, “Will you not receive correction and listen to my words? —this is Yahweh’s declaration.


## Jeremiah 35:14 (id: 924035014)

14The words of Jonadab son of Rekab that he gave to his sons as a command, not to drink any wine, have been observed to this very day. They have obeyed their ancestor’s command. But as for me, I myself have been making persistent proclamations to you, but you do not listen to me.


## Jeremiah 35:15 (id: 924035015)

15I sent out to you all my servants, the prophets. I was persistent in sending them to say, ‘Let each person turn from his wicked way and do good deeds; let no one walk any longer after other gods and worship them. Instead, come back to the land that I gave to you and your ancestors.’ Yet you will not listen to me or pay attention to me.


## Jeremiah 35:16 (id: 924035016)

16For the descendants of Jonadab son of Rekab have observed the commands of their ancestor that he gave them, but this people refuses to listen to me.”’


## Jeremiah 35:17 (id: 924035017)

17So Yahweh, God of hosts and God of Israel, says this, ‘Look, I am bringing upon Judah and on everyone living in Jerusalem, all the disasters I pronounced against them because I spoke to them, but they did not listen; I called to them, but they did not answer.’”


## Jeremiah 35:18 (id: 924035018)

18Jeremiah said to the family of the Rekabites, “Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this: You have listened to the commands of Jonadab your ancestor and have kept them all—you have obeyed all that he commanded you to do—


## Jeremiah 35:19 (id: 924035019)

19so Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this, ‘There will always be someone descended from Jonadab son of Rekab to serve me.’”


## Jeremiah 36:1 (id: 924036001)

1It came about in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, that this word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, and he said,


## Jeremiah 36:2 (id: 924036002)

2“Take a scroll for yourself and write on it all the words that I have told you concerning Israel and Judah, and every nation. Do this for everything I have told from the days of Josiah until this very day.


## Jeremiah 36:3 (id: 924036003)

3Perhaps the people of Judah will listen to all the disasters that I intend to bring on them. Perhaps everyone will turn away from his wicked way, so I can forgive their iniquity and their sin.”


## Jeremiah 36:4 (id: 924036004)

4Then Jeremiah called Baruch son of Neriah, and Baruch wrote in a scroll, at Jeremiah’s dictation, all the words of Yahweh spoken to him.


## Jeremiah 36:5 (id: 924036005)

5Next Jeremiah gave a command to Baruch. He said, “I am in prison and cannot go to Yahweh’s house.


## Jeremiah 36:6 (id: 924036006)

6So you must go and read from the scroll that you wrote at my dictation. On the day of the fast, you must read Yahweh’s words in the hearing of the people in his house, and also in the hearing of all of Judah who have come from their cities. Proclaim these words to them.


## Jeremiah 36:7 (id: 924036007)

7Perhaps their pleas for mercy will come before Yahweh. Perhaps each person will turn from his wicked way, since the wrath and fury that Yahweh has proclaimed against this people are severe.”


## Jeremiah 36:8 (id: 924036008)

8So Baruch son of Neriah did everything that Jeremiah the prophet had commanded him to do. He read aloud the words of Yahweh in the house of Yahweh.


## Jeremiah 36:9 (id: 924036009)

9It came about in the fifth year and ninth month of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah, that all the people in Jerusalem and the people who came to Jerusalem from the cities of Judah proclaimed a fast before Yahweh.


## Jeremiah 36:10 (id: 924036010)

10Baruch read aloud Jeremiah’s words in the house of Yahweh, from the room of Gemariah son of Shaphan the scribe, in the upper courtyard, by the gate of the entrance to the house of Yahweh. He did this in the hearing of all the people.


## Jeremiah 36:11 (id: 924036011)

11Now Micaiah son of Gemariah son of Shaphan heard all of Yahweh’s words in the scroll.


## Jeremiah 36:12 (id: 924036012)

12He went down to the house of the king, to the secretary’s room. Look, all the officials were sitting there: Elishama the secretary, Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Akbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the officials.


## Jeremiah 36:13 (id: 924036013)

13Then Micaiah reported to them all the words that he had heard that Baruch read aloud in the hearing of the people.


## Jeremiah 36:14 (id: 924036014)

14So all the officials sent Jehudi son of Nethaniah son of Shelemiah son of Cushi, to Baruch. Jehudi said to Baruch, “Take the scroll in your hand, the scroll from which you were reading in the hearing of the people, and come.” So Baruch son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand and went to the officials.


## Jeremiah 36:15 (id: 924036015)

15Then they said to him, “Sit down and read this in our hearing.” So Baruch read the scroll.


## Jeremiah 36:16 (id: 924036016)

16It happened that when they heard all these words, each man turned in fear to the one next to him and said to Baruch, “We must certainly report all of these words to the king.”


## Jeremiah 36:17 (id: 924036017)

17Then they asked Baruch, “Tell us, how did you come to write all these words at Jeremiah’s dictation?”


## Jeremiah 36:18 (id: 924036018)

18Baruch said to them, “He dictated all these words to me, and I wrote them in ink on this scroll.”


## Jeremiah 36:19 (id: 924036019)

19Then the officials said to Baruch, “Go, hide yourself, and Jeremiah, too. Do not let anyone know where you are.”


## Jeremiah 36:20 (id: 924036020)

20So they put the scroll in the room of Elishama the secretary, and they went to the king in the courtyard and they reported everything in the hearing of the king.


## Jeremiah 36:21 (id: 924036021)

21Then the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll. Jehudi took it from the room of Elishama the secretary. Then he read it in the hearing of the king and all the officials who were standing beside him.


## Jeremiah 36:22 (id: 924036022)

22Now the king was staying in the winter house in the ninth month, and a brazier was burning in front of him.


## Jeremiah 36:23 (id: 924036023)

23It happened that as Jehudi read three or four columns, the king would cut it off with a knife and throw it into the fire in the brazier until all of the scroll was destroyed.


## Jeremiah 36:24 (id: 924036024)

24But neither the king nor any of his servants who heard all these words were frightened, nor did they tear their clothes.


## Jeremiah 36:25 (id: 924036025)

25Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah had even urged the king not to burn the scroll, but he did not listen to them.


## Jeremiah 36:26 (id: 924036026)

26Then the king commanded Jerahmeel, a relative, Seraiah son of Azriel, and Shelemiah son of Abdeel to arrest Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet, but Yahweh had hidden them.


## Jeremiah 36:27 (id: 924036027)

27Then the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah after the king had burned the scroll and the words that Baruch had written at Jeremiah’s dictation, saying,


## Jeremiah 36:28 (id: 924036028)

28“Go back, take another scroll for yourself, and write in it all the words that were on the original scroll, the one that Jehoiakim king of Judah burned.


## Jeremiah 36:29 (id: 924036029)

29Then you must say this to Jehoiakim king of Judah: ‘You burned that scroll, saying, “Why have you written on it, ‘The king of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land, for he will destroy both man and beast in it’?”’”


## Jeremiah 36:30 (id: 924036030)

30Therefore Yahweh says this concerning you, Jehoiakim king of Judah: “No descendant of yours will ever sit on the throne of David. As for you, your corpse will be thrown out into the heat of day and the frost of night.


## Jeremiah 36:31 (id: 924036031)

31For I will punish you, your descendants, and your servants for the iniquity of you all. I will bring on you, on all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and on every person in Judah all the disasters with which I have threatened you with, but to which you paid no attention.”


## Jeremiah 36:32 (id: 924036032)

32So Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch son of Neriah the scribe. Baruch wrote on it at Jeremiah’s dictation all the words that had been in the scroll burned by Jehoiakim king of Judah. Furthermore, many other similar words were added to this scroll.


## Jeremiah 37:1 (id: 924037001)

1Now Zedekiah son of Josiah reigned as king instead of Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim. Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had made Zedekiah king over the land of Judah.


## Jeremiah 37:2 (id: 924037002)

2But Zedekiah, his servants, and the people of the land did not listen to the words of Yahweh that he proclaimed by the hand of Jeremiah the prophet.


## Jeremiah 37:3 (id: 924037003)

3So King Zedekiah, Jehukal son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah son of Maaseiah the priest sent a message to Jeremiah the prophet. They said, “Pray on our behalf to Yahweh our God.”


## Jeremiah 37:4 (id: 924037004)

4Now Jeremiah was coming and going among the people, for he had not yet been put in prison.


## Jeremiah 37:5 (id: 924037005)

5Pharaoh’s army came out from Egypt, and the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard the news about them and left Jerusalem.


## Jeremiah 37:6 (id: 924037006)

6Then the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah the prophet, saying,


## Jeremiah 37:7 (id: 924037007)

7“Yahweh, God of Israel, says this: This is what you will say to the king of Judah, because he has sent you to seek advice from me, ‘See, Pharaoh’s army, which came to help you, is about to go back to Egypt, its own land.


## Jeremiah 37:8 (id: 924037008)

8The Chaldeans will return. They will fight against this city, capture it, and burn it.’


## Jeremiah 37:9 (id: 924037009)

9Yahweh says this: Do not deceive yourselves by saying, ‘Surely the Chaldeans are leaving us,’ for they will not leave.


## Jeremiah 37:10 (id: 924037010)

10Even if you had defeated the entire Chaldean army that is fighting you so that only wounded men were left in their tents, they would get up and burn this city.”


## Jeremiah 37:11 (id: 924037011)

11So it was when the Chaldean army had left Jerusalem as Pharaoh’s army was coming,


## Jeremiah 37:12 (id: 924037012)

12then Jeremiah went out from Jerusalem to go to the land of Benjamin. He wanted to take possession of a tract of land there among his people.


## Jeremiah 37:13 (id: 924037013)

13As he was in the Benjamin Gate, a chief guard was there. His name was Irijah son of Shelemiah son of Hananiah. He grabbed hold of Jeremiah the prophet and said, “You are deserting to the Chaldeans.”


## Jeremiah 37:14 (id: 924037014)

14But Jeremiah said, “That is not true. I am not deserting to the Chaldeans.” But Irijah did not listen to him. He took Jeremiah and brought him to the officials.


## Jeremiah 37:15 (id: 924037015)

15The officials were angry with Jeremiah. They beat him and put him in prison, which had been the house of Jonathan the scribe, for they had turned it into a prison.


## Jeremiah 37:16 (id: 924037016)

16So Jeremiah was put into an underground cell, where he stayed for many days.


## Jeremiah 37:17 (id: 924037017)

17Then King Zedekiah sent someone who brought him to the palace. In his house, the king asked him privately, “Is there any word from Yahweh?” Jeremiah answered, “There is a word: You will be given into the hand of the king of Babylon.”


## Jeremiah 37:18 (id: 924037018)

18Then Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, “How have I sinned against you, your servants, or this people so that you have placed me in prison?


## Jeremiah 37:19 (id: 924037019)

19Where are your prophets, the ones who prophesied for you and said the king of Babylon will not come against you or against this land?


## Jeremiah 37:20 (id: 924037020)

20But now listen, my master the king! Let my pleas come before you. Do not return me to the house of Jonathan the scribe, or I will die there.”


## Jeremiah 37:21 (id: 924037021)

21So King Zedekiah gave an order. His servants confined Jeremiah in the courtyard of the guard. A loaf of bread was given him every day from the street of the bakers, until all the bread in the city was gone. So Jeremiah stayed in the courtyard of the guard.


## Jeremiah 38:1 (id: 924038001)

1Shephatiah son of Mattan, Gedaliah son of Pashhur, Jehukal son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur son of Malkijah heard the words that Jeremiah was declaring to all the people. He was saying,


## Jeremiah 38:2 (id: 924038002)

2“Yahweh says this: Anyone staying in this city will be killed by sword, famine, and plague. But anyone who goes out to the Chaldeans will survive. He will escape with his own life, and live.


## Jeremiah 38:3 (id: 924038003)

3Yahweh says this: This city will be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon, and he will capture it.”


## Jeremiah 38:4 (id: 924038004)

4So the officials said to the king, “Let this man die, for in this way he is weakening the hands of the fighting men who remain in this city, and the hands of all the people. He is proclaiming these words, for this man is not working for safety for this people, but disaster.”


## Jeremiah 38:5 (id: 924038005)

5So King Zedekiah said, “Look, he is in your hand since there is no king able to resist you.”


## Jeremiah 38:6 (id: 924038006)

6Then they took Jeremiah and threw him into the cistern of Malkijah, son of the king. The cistern was in the courtyard of the guard. They lowered Jeremiah down on ropes. There was no water in the cistern, but it was muddy, and he sank down into the mud.


## Jeremiah 38:7 (id: 924038007)

7Now Ebed\-Melek the Cushite was one of the eunuchs in the king’s house. He heard that they had placed Jeremiah in the cistern. Now the king was sitting at the Benjamin Gate.


## Jeremiah 38:8 (id: 924038008)

8So Ebed\-Melek went from the king’s house and spoke with the king. He said,


## Jeremiah 38:9 (id: 924038009)

9“My master the king, these men have done evil with the way they have treated Jeremiah the prophet. They threw him into a cistern for him to die in it from hunger, since there is no more food in the city.”


## Jeremiah 38:10 (id: 924038010)

10Then the king gave a command to Ebed\-Melek the Cushite. He said, “Take command of thirty men from here and take Jeremiah the prophet out of the cistern before he dies.”


## Jeremiah 38:11 (id: 924038011)

11So Ebed\-Melek took command of those men and went to the king’s house, to a storeroom for clothing under the house. From there he took rags and worn\-out clothing and then let them down by ropes to Jeremiah in the cistern.


## Jeremiah 38:12 (id: 924038012)

12Ebed\-Melek the Cushite said to Jeremiah, “Put the rags and worn\-out clothing under your arms and on top of the ropes.” So Jeremiah did so.


## Jeremiah 38:13 (id: 924038013)

13Then they pulled Jeremiah by the ropes. In this way they brought him up from the cistern. So Jeremiah stayed in the courtyard of the guard.


## Jeremiah 38:14 (id: 924038014)

14Then King Zedekiah sent word and brought Jeremiah the prophet to himself, to the third entrance in Yahweh’s house. The king said to Jeremiah, “I want to ask you something. Do not keep the answer from me.”


## Jeremiah 38:15 (id: 924038015)

15Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “If I answer you, will you not certainly kill me? But if I give you advice, you will not listen to me.”


## Jeremiah 38:16 (id: 924038016)

16But King Zedekiah swore to Jeremiah in private and said, “As Yahweh lives, the one who made us, I will not kill you or give you into the hand of those men who are seeking your life.”


## Jeremiah 38:17 (id: 924038017)

17So Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “Yahweh, God of hosts, God of Israel, says this: If you indeed go out to the officials of the king of Babylon then you will live, and this city will not be burned. You and your family will live.


## Jeremiah 38:18 (id: 924038018)

18But if you do not go out to the officials of the king of Babylon, then this city will be given into the hand of the Chaldeans. They will burn it, and you will not escape from their hand.”


## Jeremiah 38:19 (id: 924038019)

19King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “But I am afraid of the people of Judah who have deserted to the Chaldeans, because I might be given over into their hand, for them to treat me badly.”


## Jeremiah 38:20 (id: 924038020)

20Jeremiah said, “They will not give you over to them. Obey the message from Yahweh that I am telling you, so that things will go well for you, and so that you will live.


## Jeremiah 38:21 (id: 924038021)

21But if you refuse to go out, this is what Yahweh has shown me.


## Jeremiah 38:22 (id: 924038022)

22Look! All the women who are left in your house, king of Judah, will be brought out to the officials of the king of Babylon. These women will say to you, ‘You have been deceived by your friends; they have ruined you. Your feet are now sunk into the mud, and your friends will run away.’


## Jeremiah 38:23 (id: 924038023)

23For all of your wives and children will be brought out to the Chaldeans, and you yourself will not escape from their hand. You will be captured by the hand of the king of Babylon, and this city will be burned.”


## Jeremiah 38:24 (id: 924038024)

24Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “Do not inform anyone about these words, so that you do not die.


## Jeremiah 38:25 (id: 924038025)

25If the officials hear that I have talked with you, and if they come and say to you, ‘Tell us what you said to the king and do not hide it from us, or we will kill you,’


## Jeremiah 38:26 (id: 924038026)

26then you must say to them, ‘I made a humble plea before the king that he would not return me to the house of Jonathan to die there.’”


## Jeremiah 38:27 (id: 924038027)

27Then all the officials came to Jeremiah and questioned him, so he answered them as the king had instructed him. So they stopped talking with him, because they had not heard the conversation between Jeremiah and the king.


## Jeremiah 38:28 (id: 924038028)

28So Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard until the day Jerusalem was captured.


## Jeremiah 39:1 (id: 924039001)

1In the ninth year and tenth month of Zedekiah king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came with all his army against Jerusalem and besieged it.


## Jeremiah 39:2 (id: 924039002)

2In the eleventh year and fourth month of Zedekiah, on the ninth day of the month, the city was broken into.


## Jeremiah 39:3 (id: 924039003)

3Then all the officials of the king of Babylon came and sat in the middle gate: Nebo\-Sarsekim, Samgar Nebo, and Sarsechim, an important official. Nebo\-Sarsekim was a high official and all the rest were the officials of the king of Babylon.


## Jeremiah 39:4 (id: 924039004)

4It happened that when Zedekiah, king of Judah, and all his fighting men saw them, they fled. They went out at night from the city by the king’s garden path, through the gate between the two walls. The king went out in the direction of the Arabah.


## Jeremiah 39:5 (id: 924039005)

5But the army of Chaldeans pursued them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of the Jordan River valley near Jericho. Then they captured him and brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, at Riblah in the land of Hamath, where Nebuchadnezzar passed sentence on him.


## Jeremiah 39:6 (id: 924039006)

6The king of Babylon slaughtered Zedekiah’s sons before his own eyes at Riblah. He also slaughtered all the noblemen of Judah.


## Jeremiah 39:7 (id: 924039007)

7Then he put out Zedekiah’s eyes and bound him in bronze chains in order to take him to Babylon.


## Jeremiah 39:8 (id: 924039008)

8Then the Chaldeans burned the king’s house and the people’s houses. They also tore down the walls of Jerusalem.


## Jeremiah 39:9 (id: 924039009)

9Nebuzaradan, the commander of the king’s bodyguards, took into exile the rest of the people who were left in the city. This included the people who had deserted to the Chaldeans and the rest of the people who were left in the city.


## Jeremiah 39:10 (id: 924039010)

10But Nebuzaradan the commander of the king’s bodyguards allowed the poorest people who had nothing for themselves to remain in the land of Judah. He gave them vineyards and fields on that same day.


## Jeremiah 39:11 (id: 924039011)

11Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had given an order about Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the commander of the king’s bodyguards. He had said,


## Jeremiah 39:12 (id: 924039012)

12“Take him and care for him. Do not harm him. Do for him anything he tells you.”


## Jeremiah 39:13 (id: 924039013)

13So Nebuzaradan the commander of the king’s bodyguards, Nebushazban the high eunuch, Nergal\-Sharezer the high official, and all the most important officials of the king of Babylon sent men out.


## Jeremiah 39:14 (id: 924039014)

14Their men took Jeremiah from the courtyard of the guard and entrusted him to Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan, to take him home, so Jeremiah stayed among the people.


## Jeremiah 39:15 (id: 924039015)

15Now the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah while he was under arrest in the courtyard of the guard, saying,


## Jeremiah 39:16 (id: 924039016)

16“Speak to Ebed\-Melek the Cushite and say, ‘Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this: See, I am about to carry out my words against this city for disaster and not for good. For they will all come true before you on that day.


## Jeremiah 39:17 (id: 924039017)

17But I will rescue you on that day—this is Yahweh’s declaration—and you will not be given into the hand of the men whom you fear.


## Jeremiah 39:18 (id: 924039018)

18For I will certainly rescue you. You will not fall by the sword. You will escape with your life, since you trust in me—this was Yahweh’s declaration.’”


## Jeremiah 40:1 (id: 924040001)

1The word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh after Nebuzaradan the commander of the king’s bodyguards had released him at Ramah. He had found Jeremiah bound with chains among all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah who were being carried into exile to Babylon.


## Jeremiah 40:2 (id: 924040002)

2The chief guard took Jeremiah and said to him, “Yahweh your God decreed this disaster for this place.


## Jeremiah 40:3 (id: 924040003)

3So Yahweh brought it about. He did just as he had decreed, since you people sinned against him and did not obey his voice. That is why this thing has happened to you people.


## Jeremiah 40:4 (id: 924040004)

4But now look! I have released you today from the chains that were on your hands. If it is good in your eyes to come with me to Babylon, come, and I will take care of you. But if it is not good in your eyes to come with me to Babylon, then do not do so. Look at all the land before you. Go where it is good and right in your eyes to go.”


## Jeremiah 40:5 (id: 924040005)

5When Jeremiah did not reply, Nebuzaradan said, “Go to Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has put in charge of the cities of Judah. Stay with him among the people or go wherever it is good in your eyes to go.” The commander of the king’s bodyguards gave him food and a gift, and then sent him away.


## Jeremiah 40:6 (id: 924040006)

6So Jeremiah went to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, at Mizpah. He stayed with him among the people who were left behind in the land.


## Jeremiah 40:7 (id: 924040007)

7Now some commanders of Judean soldiers who were still in the countryside—they and their men—heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah son of Ahikam governor over the land. They also heard that he had put him in charge of the men, women, and children who were the poorest people in the land, those who had not been exiled to Babylon.


## Jeremiah 40:8 (id: 924040008)

8So they went to Gedaliah at Mizpah. These men were Ishmael son of Nethaniah; Johanan and Jonathan, sons of Kareah; Seraiah son of Tanhumeth; the sons of Ephai the Netophathite; and Jaazaniah son of the Maakathite—they and their men.


## Jeremiah 40:9 (id: 924040009)

9Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan took an oath to them and to their men and said to them, “Do not be afraid to serve the Chaldean officials. Live in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will go well with you.


## Jeremiah 40:10 (id: 924040010)

10Look, I am living in Mizpah to meet with the Chaldeans who came to us. So harvest wine, summer fruit, and oil and store them in your containers. Live in the cities that you have occupied.”


## Jeremiah 40:11 (id: 924040011)

11Then all the Judeans in Moab, among the people of Ammon, and in Edom, and in every land heard that the king of Babylon had allowed a remnant of Judah to stay, that he had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan over them.


## Jeremiah 40:12 (id: 924040012)

12So all the Judeans returned from every place where they had been scattered. They came back to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah. They harvested wine and summer fruit in great abundance.


## Jeremiah 40:13 (id: 924040013)

13Johanan son of Kareah and all the army commanders in the countryside came to Gedaliah at Mizpah.


## Jeremiah 40:14 (id: 924040014)

14They said to him, “Do you realize that Baalis king of the people of Ammon sent Ishmael son of Nethaniah to murder you?” But Gedaliah son of Ahikim did not believe them.


## Jeremiah 40:15 (id: 924040015)

15So Johanan son of Kareah spoke privately to Gedaliah in Mizpah and said, “Allow me to go kill Ishmael son of Nethaniah. No one will suspect me. Why should he kill you? Why allow all of Judah that has been gathered to you to be scattered and the remnant of Judah destroyed?”


## Jeremiah 40:16 (id: 924040016)

16But Gedaliah son of Ahikam said to Johanan son of Kareah, “Do not do this thing, for you are telling lies about Ishmael.”


## Jeremiah 41:1 (id: 924041001)

1But it happened that in the seventh month Ishmael son of Nethaniah son of Elishama, from the royal family, and some officers of the king, came—ten men were with him—to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, at Mizpah. They ate food together there in Mizpah.


## Jeremiah 41:2 (id: 924041002)

2But Ishmael son of Nethaniah, and the ten men who were with him rose up and attacked Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan, with the sword. Ishmael killed Gedaliah, whom the king of Babylon had put in charge of the land.


## Jeremiah 41:3 (id: 924041003)

3Then Ishmael killed all the Judeans who were with Gedaliah in Mizpah and the Chaldean fighting men found there.


## Jeremiah 41:4 (id: 924041004)

4Then it was the second day after the killing of Gedaliah, but no one knew.


## Jeremiah 41:5 (id: 924041005)

5Some men came from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria—eighty men who had shaved their beard, torn their clothes, and cut themselves—with food offerings and frankincense in their hands to go to Yahweh’s house.


## Jeremiah 41:6 (id: 924041006)

6So Ishmael son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them as they went, walking and weeping. Then it happened that as he encountered them, he said to them, “Come to Gedaliah son of Ahikam!”


## Jeremiah 41:7 (id: 924041007)

7It came about that when they came into the city, Ishmael son of Nethaniah slaughtered them and threw them into a pit, he and the men who were with him.


## Jeremiah 41:8 (id: 924041008)

8But there were ten men among them who said to Ishmael, “Do not kill us, for there are provisions of ours in a field: Wheat and barley, oil and honey.” So he did not kill them with their other companions.


## Jeremiah 41:9 (id: 924041009)

9The cistern where Ishmael threw all the dead bodies that he had killed, was a large cistern that King Asa dug to make a defense against King Baasha of Israel. Ishmael son of Nethaniah filled it in with the dead.


## Jeremiah 41:10 (id: 924041010)

10Next Ishmael captured all the other people who were in Mizpah, the king’s daughters and all the people who were left in Mizpah whom Nebuzaradan the chief guard had assigned to Gedaliah son of Ahikam. So Ishmael son of Nethaniah captured them and went to cross over to the people of Ammon.


## Jeremiah 41:11 (id: 924041011)

11But Johanan son of Kareah and all the army commanders with him heard of all the harm that Ishmael son of Nethaniah had done.


## Jeremiah 41:12 (id: 924041012)

12So they took all their men and went to fight against Ishmael son of Nethaniah. They found him at the great pool of Gibeon.


## Jeremiah 41:13 (id: 924041013)

13Then it happened that when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan son of Kareah and all the army commanders who were with him, they were very happy.


## Jeremiah 41:14 (id: 924041014)

14So all the people whom Ishmael had captured at Mizpah turned around and went to Johanan son of Kareah.


## Jeremiah 41:15 (id: 924041015)

15But Ishmael son of Nethaniah fled with eight men from Johanan. He went to the people of Ammon.


## Jeremiah 41:16 (id: 924041016)

16Johanan son of Kareah and all the army commanders with him took from Mizpah all the people who had been rescued from Ishmael son of Nethaniah. This was after Ishmael had killed Gedaliah son of Ahikam. Johanan and his companions took the strong men, the fighting men, the women and children, and the eunuchs who had been rescued at Gibeon.


## Jeremiah 41:17 (id: 924041017)

17Then they went and stayed for a while in Geruth Kimham, which is near Bethlehem. They were going to go to Egypt


## Jeremiah 41:18 (id: 924041018)

18because of the Chaldeans. They were afraid of them since Ishmael son of Nethaniah had killed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had put in charge of the land.


## Jeremiah 42:1 (id: 924042001)

1Then all the army commanders and Johanan son of Kareah, Jezaniah son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least to the greatest approached Jeremiah the prophet.


## Jeremiah 42:2 (id: 924042002)

2They said to him, “Let our pleas come before you. Pray for us to Yahweh your God for these people who remain since we are so few in number, as you see.


## Jeremiah 42:3 (id: 924042003)

3Ask Yahweh your God to tell us the way we should go and what we should do.”


## Jeremiah 42:4 (id: 924042004)

4So Jeremiah the prophet said to them, “I have heard you. Look, I will pray to Yahweh your God as you have requested. Whatever Yahweh answers, I will tell you. I will keep nothing back from you.”


## Jeremiah 42:5 (id: 924042005)

5They said to Jeremiah, “May Yahweh be a true and faithful witness against us, if we do not do everything that Yahweh your God tells us to do.


## Jeremiah 42:6 (id: 924042006)

6Whether it is good or if it is bad, we will obey the voice of Yahweh our God, to whom we are sending you, so that it may be well with us when we obey the voice of Yahweh our God.”


## Jeremiah 42:7 (id: 924042007)

7At the end of ten days, the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah.


## Jeremiah 42:8 (id: 924042008)

8So Jeremiah called to Johanan son of Kareah and all the army commanders with him, and to all the people from the least to the greatest.


## Jeremiah 42:9 (id: 924042009)

9Then he said to them, “This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel—to whom you sent me so I might lay your pleas before him—says,


## Jeremiah 42:10 (id: 924042010)

10‘If you go back and live in this land, then I will build you and not tear you down; I will plant you and not pull you up, for I will turn back the disaster that I have brought on you.


## Jeremiah 42:11 (id: 924042011)

11Do not fear the king of Babylon, whom you are fearing. Do not fear him—this is Yahweh’s declaration—since I am with you to save you and rescue you from his hand.


## Jeremiah 42:12 (id: 924042012)

12For I will give you mercy. I will have compassion on you, and I will bring you back to your land.


## Jeremiah 42:13 (id: 924042013)

13But suppose that you say, “We will not stay in this land”—if you do not listen to my voice, the voice of Yahweh your God.


## Jeremiah 42:14 (id: 924042014)

14Suppose that you say, “No! We will go to the land of Egypt, where we will not see any war, where we will not hear the sound of the trumpet, and we will not go hungry for food. We will live there.”


## Jeremiah 42:15 (id: 924042015)

15Now listen to this word of Yahweh, you remnant of Judah. Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this, ‘If you actually set out to go to Egypt, to go and live there,


## Jeremiah 42:16 (id: 924042016)

16then the sword that you fear will overtake you there in the land of Egypt. The famine that you are worrying about will pursue you to Egypt, and you will die there.


## Jeremiah 42:17 (id: 924042017)

17So it will happen that all the men who set out to go to Egypt to live there will die by sword, famine, or plague. There will be no survivor of them, no one to escape the disaster that I will bring on them.


## Jeremiah 42:18 (id: 924042018)

18For Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this: Just as my wrath and my fury were poured out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, in the same way my fury will be poured out on you if you go to Egypt. You will become an object of cursing and a horror, an object for speaking curses, and something dishonorable, and you will not see this place again.’”


## Jeremiah 42:19 (id: 924042019)

19Then Jeremiah said, “Yahweh has spoken concerning you—the remnant of Judah. Do not go to Egypt! You certainly know that I have been a witness against you today.


## Jeremiah 42:20 (id: 924042020)

20For you fatally deceived yourselves when you sent me to Yahweh your God and said, ‘Pray to Yahweh our God for us. Everything that Yahweh our God says, tell us, and we will carry it out.’


## Jeremiah 42:21 (id: 924042021)

21For I have reported to you today, but you have not listened to the voice of Yahweh your God or to anything about which he sent me to you.


## Jeremiah 42:22 (id: 924042022)

22So now, you should certainly know that you will die by sword, famine, and plague in the place where you desired to go to live.”


## Jeremiah 43:1 (id: 924043001)

1It happened that Jeremiah finished proclaiming to all the people all the words of Yahweh their God that Yahweh their God had told him to say.


## Jeremiah 43:2 (id: 924043002)

2Azariah son of Hoshaiah, Johanan son of Kareah, and all the arrogant men said to Jeremiah, “You are telling lies. Yahweh our God has not sent you to say, ‘Do not go to Egypt to live there.’


## Jeremiah 43:3 (id: 924043003)

3For Baruch son of Neriah is inciting you against us to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, for you to cause our death and to make us captives in Babylon.”


## Jeremiah 43:4 (id: 924043004)

4So Johanan son of Kareah, all the princes of the army, and all the people refused to listen to Yahweh’s voice to live in the land of Judah.


## Jeremiah 43:5 (id: 924043005)

5Johanan son of Kareah and all the army commanders took away all the remnant of Judah who had returned from all the nations where they had been scattered to live in the land of Judah.


## Jeremiah 43:6 (id: 924043006)

6They took the men and women, the children and the king’s daughters, and every person whom Nebuzaradan, the commander of the king’s bodyguards, had let remain with Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan. They also took Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch son of Neriah.


## Jeremiah 43:7 (id: 924043007)

7They went to the land of Egypt, to Tahpanhes, because they did not listen to Yahweh’s voice.


## Jeremiah 43:8 (id: 924043008)

8So the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,


## Jeremiah 43:9 (id: 924043009)

9“Take some large stones in your hand, and, in the sight of the people of Judah, hide them in the mortar in the pavement at the entrance to Pharaoh’s house in Tahpanhes.”


## Jeremiah 43:10 (id: 924043010)

10Then say to them, “Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this, ‘See, I am about to send messengers to take Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon as my servant. I will place his throne over these stones that you, Jeremiah, have buried. Nebuchadnezzar will place his pavilion over them.


## Jeremiah 43:11 (id: 924043011)

11For he will come and attack the land of Egypt. Anyone who is assigned to death will be given to death. Anyone who is assigned to captivity will be taken captive. Anyone who is assigned to the sword will be given to the sword.


## Jeremiah 43:12 (id: 924043012)

12Then I will light a fire in the temples of Egypt’s gods. Nebuchadnezzar will burn them or capture them. He will clean out the land of Egypt just as shepherds clean vermin off their clothes. He will go out from that place in victory.


## Jeremiah 43:13 (id: 924043013)

13He will break the stone pillars at Heliopolis in the land of Egypt. He will burn the temples of Egypt’s gods.’”


## Jeremiah 44:1 (id: 924044001)

1The word came to Jeremiah concerning all the Judeans who lived in the land of Egypt, the ones staying in Migdol, Tahpanhes, Memphis, and in Upper Egypt:


## Jeremiah 44:2 (id: 924044002)

2“Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says, ‘You yourselves have seen all the disasters that I brought on Jerusalem and all the cities of Judah. See, they are ruins today. There is no one to live in them.


## Jeremiah 44:3 (id: 924044003)

3This is because of the wicked things they did to offend me by going to burn incense and to worship other gods. These were gods that neither they themselves, nor you, nor your ancestors knew.’


## Jeremiah 44:4 (id: 924044004)

4So I repeatedly sent all of my servants the prophets to them. I sent them to say, ‘Stop doing these abominable things that I hate.’


## Jeremiah 44:5 (id: 924044005)

5But they did not listen. They refused to pay attention or turn from their wickedness in burning incense to other gods.


## Jeremiah 44:6 (id: 924044006)

6So my fury and my wrath were poured out and kindled a fire in the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem. So they became ruins and devastations, as at this present day.’


## Jeremiah 44:7 (id: 924044007)

7So now Yahweh, the God of hosts and the God of Israel, says this, ‘Why are you doing great wickedness against yourselves? Why are you causing yourselves to be cut off from among Judah—men and women, children and babies? No remnant of you will be left.


## Jeremiah 44:8 (id: 924044008)

8By your wickedness you have offended me with the deeds of your hands, by burning incense to other gods in the land of Egypt, where you have gone to live. You have gone there so that you will be destroyed, so that you will be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth.


## Jeremiah 44:9 (id: 924044009)

9Have you forgotten the wickedness committed by your ancestors and the wickedness committed by the kings of Judah and their wives? Have you forgotten the evil committed by yourselves and your wives in the land of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem?


## Jeremiah 44:10 (id: 924044010)

10To this day, they still are not humbled. They do not honor my law or decrees that I placed before them and their ancestors, nor do they walk in them.’


## Jeremiah 44:11 (id: 924044011)

11Therefore Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this, ‘See, I am about to set my face against you to bring disaster to you and to destroy all of Judah.


## Jeremiah 44:12 (id: 924044012)

12For I will take the remnant of Judah that has set out to go to the land of Egypt to live there. I will do this so that they will all perish in the land of Egypt. They will fall by sword and famine. From the least to the greatest they will perish by sword and famine. They will die and will become an object of swearing, cursing, reproaching, and a horrible thing.


## Jeremiah 44:13 (id: 924044013)

13For I will punish the people inhabiting the land of Egypt just as I punished Jerusalem with the sword, with famine, and with the plague,


## Jeremiah 44:14 (id: 924044014)

14so that none of the remnant of Judah who have gone to live in the land of Egypt will escape or survive or return to the land of Judah, to which they desire to return and live; and none of them will return except a few who escaped from there.’”


## Jeremiah 44:15 (id: 924044015)

15Then all the men who knew that their wives were burning incense to other gods, and all the women who were in the great assembly, and all the people who were living in Lower and Upper Egypt, answered Jeremiah.


## Jeremiah 44:16 (id: 924044016)

16They said, “About the word that you have told us in Yahweh’s name—we will not listen to you.


## Jeremiah 44:17 (id: 924044017)

17For we will certainly do all the things that we said we would do—burn incense to the queen of heaven and pour out drink offerings to her just as we, our ancestors, our kings, and our leaders did in the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem. Then we will be filled with food and will prosper, without experiencing any disaster.


## Jeremiah 44:18 (id: 924044018)

18When we refrained from doing these things, not offering incense to the queen of heaven and not pouring out drink offerings to her, we were all suffering poverty and were dying by sword and famine.”


## Jeremiah 44:19 (id: 924044019)

19The women said, “When we were making incense offerings before the queen of heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, was it against our husbands that we did these things, making cakes in her image and pouring out drink offerings to her?”


## Jeremiah 44:20 (id: 924044020)

20Then Jeremiah said to all the people—to the men and women, and all the people who answered him—he proclaimed and said,


## Jeremiah 44:21 (id: 924044021)

21“Did not Yahweh remember the incense that you burned in the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem—you and your ancestors, your kings and leaders, and the people of the land? For Yahweh calls this to mind; it comes to his thoughts.


## Jeremiah 44:22 (id: 924044022)

22Then he was no longer able to bear it because of your wicked practices, because of the abominations that you did. Then your land became a desolation, a horror, and a curse so there was no longer an inhabitant as at this present day.


## Jeremiah 44:23 (id: 924044023)

23Because you burned incense and sinned against Yahweh, and because you would not listen to his voice, his law, his statutes, or his covenant decrees, this disaster against you has happened as at this present day.”


## Jeremiah 44:24 (id: 924044024)

24Then Jeremiah said to all the people and all the women, “Hear the word of Yahweh, all of Judah who are in the land of Egypt.


## Jeremiah 44:25 (id: 924044025)

25Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this, ‘You and your wives both have said with your mouths and carried out with your hands what you said, “We will certainly carry out the vows that we made to worship the queen of heaven, to pour out drink offerings to her.” Now fulfill your vows; carry them out.’


## Jeremiah 44:26 (id: 924044026)

26So then, hear the word of Yahweh, all of Judah who are staying in the land of Egypt, ‘See, I have sworn by my great name—says Yahweh. My name will no longer be called upon by the mouths of any of the men of Judah in all the land of Egypt, you who now say, “As the Lord Yahweh lives.”


## Jeremiah 44:27 (id: 924044027)

27See, I am watching over them for disaster and not for good. Every person of Judah in the land of Egypt will perish by sword and famine until they are all finished.


## Jeremiah 44:28 (id: 924044028)

28Then the survivors of the sword will return from the land of Egypt to the land of Judah, only a small number of them. So all the remnant of Judah who went to the land of Egypt to live there will know whose word will stand—mine or theirs.


## Jeremiah 44:29 (id: 924044029)

29This will be the sign for you—this is Yahweh’s declaration—that I am setting against you in this place, so that you will know that my words will certainly attack you with disaster.’


## Jeremiah 44:30 (id: 924044030)

30Yahweh says this, ‘Look, I am about to give Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies and into the hand of those who seek to kill him. It will the same as when I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, his enemy who sought his life.’”


## Jeremiah 45:1 (id: 924045001)

1This is the word that Jeremiah the prophet told Baruch son of Neriah. This happened when he wrote in a scroll these words at Jeremiah’s dictation—this was in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah, and he said,


## Jeremiah 45:2 (id: 924045002)

2“Yahweh, God of Israel, says this to you, Baruch:


## Jeremiah 45:3 (id: 924045003)

3You have said, ‘Woe is me, for Yahweh has added agony to my pain. My groaning has wearied me; I find no rest.’


## Jeremiah 45:4 (id: 924045004)

4This is what you must say to him: ‘Yahweh says this: See, what I built, I am now tearing down. What I planted, I am now pulling up—I will do this throughout all the earth.


## Jeremiah 45:5 (id: 924045005)

5But are you hoping for great things for yourself? Do not hope for that. For see, disaster is coming on all humanity—this is Yahweh’s declaration—but I am giving you your life as your plunder everywhere you will go.’”


## Jeremiah 46:1 (id: 924046001)

1This is the word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the nations.


## Jeremiah 46:2 (id: 924046002)

2For Egypt: “This is about the army of Pharaoh Necho, king of Egypt that was at Carchemish by the Euphrates river. This was the army that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon defeated in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah:


## Jeremiah 46:3 (id: 924046003)

3Get the small shields and the large shields ready, and go forward to fight.


## Jeremiah 46:4 (id: 924046004)

4Put the harness on the horses; mount up on the horses and take your stand with your helmets on; polish the spears and put on your armor.


## Jeremiah 46:5 (id: 924046005)

5What am I seeing here? They are filled with terror and are running away, for their soldiers are defeated. They are running for safety and are not looking back. Terror is all around—this is Yahweh’s declaration—


## Jeremiah 46:6 (id: 924046006)

6the swift cannot run away, and the soldiers cannot escape. They stumble in the north and fall beside the Euphrates River.


## Jeremiah 46:7 (id: 924046007)

7Who is this who rises like the Nile, whose waters toss up and down like the rivers?


## Jeremiah 46:8 (id: 924046008)

8Egypt rises like the Nile, like rivers of water that rise and fall. Egypt says, ‘I will go up and I will cover the earth. I will destroy cities and their inhabitants.


## Jeremiah 46:9 (id: 924046009)

9Go up, horses. Be angry, you chariots. Let the soldiers go out, Cush and Put, men skillful with a shield, and Ludim, men skillful at bending their bows.’


## Jeremiah 46:10 (id: 924046010)

10That day will be the day of vengeance for the Lord Yahweh of hosts, and he will avenge himself on his foes. The sword will devour and be satisfied. It will drink its fill of their blood. For there will be a sacrifice to the Yahweh Lord of hosts in the northern land by the Euphrates River.


## Jeremiah 46:11 (id: 924046011)

11Go up to Gilead and obtain medicine, virgin daughter of Egypt. It is useless that you put much medicine on yourself. There is no cure for you.


## Jeremiah 46:12 (id: 924046012)

12The nations have heard of your disgrace. The earth is filled with your laments, for soldier stumbles against soldier; both of them fall together.”


## Jeremiah 46:13 (id: 924046013)

13This is the word that Yahweh told Jeremiah the prophet when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came and attacked the land of Egypt:


## Jeremiah 46:14 (id: 924046014)

14“Announce in Egypt, and proclaim it in Migdol, Memphis, and Tahpanhes. ‘Take your station and prepare yourself, for the sword will devour those around you.’


## Jeremiah 46:15 (id: 924046015)

15Why are your mighty ones face\-down on the ground? They will not stand, because I, Yahweh, have pushed them to the ground.


## Jeremiah 46:16 (id: 924046016)

16He increases the numbers of those who stumble. Each soldier falls against the next one. They are saying, ‘Get up. Let us go home. Let us go back to our own people, to our native land. Let us leave this sword that is beating us down.’


## Jeremiah 46:17 (id: 924046017)

17They proclaimed there, ‘Pharaoh the king of Egypt is only a noise, one who has let his opportunity slip away.’


## Jeremiah 46:18 (id: 924046018)

18As I live—declares the King, whose name is Yahweh of hosts— someone will come like Mount Tabor and Mount Carmel by the sea.


## Jeremiah 46:19 (id: 924046019)

19Pack for yourselves baggage to carry into exile, you who live in Egypt. For Memphis will become a waste, it will lie in ruins and no one will live there.


## Jeremiah 46:20 (id: 924046020)

20Egypt is a very beautiful young cow, but a stinging insect is coming from the north. It is coming.


## Jeremiah 46:21 (id: 924046021)

21The hired soldiers in her midst are like a fattened bull, but they will also turn away and run away. They will not stand together, for the day of their disaster is coming against them, the time of their punishment.


## Jeremiah 46:22 (id: 924046022)

22Egypt hisses like a snake and crawls away, for her enemies are marching against her. They are going toward her like woodcutters with axes.


## Jeremiah 46:23 (id: 924046023)

23They will cut down the forests—this is Yahweh’s declaration—although it is very dense. For the enemies will be more numerous than locusts, unable to be counted.


## Jeremiah 46:24 (id: 924046024)

24The daughter of Egypt will be made ashamed. She will be given into the hand of people from the north.”


## Jeremiah 46:25 (id: 924046025)

25Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, says, “See, I am about to punish Amon of Thebes, Pharaoh, Egypt and her gods, her kings the Pharaohs, and those who trust in them.


## Jeremiah 46:26 (id: 924046026)

26I am giving them into the hand of the ones seeking their lives, and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and his servants. Then after this Egypt will be inhabited as in previous days—this is Yahweh’s declaration.


## Jeremiah 46:27 (id: 924046027)

27But you, my servant Jacob, do not fear. Do not be dismayed, Israel, for see, I am about to bring you back from far away, and your offspring from the land of their captivity. Then Jacob will return, find peace, and be secure, and there will be no one to terrify him.


## Jeremiah 46:28 (id: 924046028)

28You, my servant Jacob, do not fear—this is Yahweh’s declaration—for I am with you, so I will bring complete destruction against all the nations where I scattered you. But I will not destroy you completely. Yet I will discipline you justly and will certainly not leave you unpunished.”


## Jeremiah 47:1 (id: 924047001)

1This is the word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the Philistines. This word came to him before Pharaoh attacked Gaza.


## Jeremiah 47:2 (id: 924047002)

2“Yahweh says this: See, floods of water are rising in the north. They will be like an overflowing river! Then they will overflow the land and everything in it, its cities and its inhabitants! So everyone will shout for help, and all the inhabitants of the land will lament.


## Jeremiah 47:3 (id: 924047003)

3At the sound of the stamping of their strong horses’ hooves, at the roar of their chariots and the noise of their wheels, fathers will not help their children because of their own weakness.


## Jeremiah 47:4 (id: 924047004)

4For the day is coming that will devastate all of the Philistines, to cut off from Tyre and Sidon every survivor who wants to help them. For Yahweh is devastating the Philistines, those who remain from the island of Caphtor.


## Jeremiah 47:5 (id: 924047005)

5Baldness will come upon Gaza. As for Ashkelon, the people who are left in their valley will be made silent. How long will you cut yourself in mourning?


## Jeremiah 47:6 (id: 924047006)

6Woe, sword of Yahweh! How long will it be until you become silent? Go back to your scabbard! Stop and be silent.


## Jeremiah 47:7 (id: 924047007)

7How can it rest when Yahweh has commanded it, when he has ordered it to attack Ashkelon and the coastlands along the sea?”


## Jeremiah 48:1 (id: 924048001)

1To Moab, Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this, “Woe to Nebo, for it has been devastated. Kiriathaim has been humiliated and captured. Her fortress has been disgraced and crushed.


## Jeremiah 48:2 (id: 924048002)

2The honor of Moab is no more. Their enemies in Heshbon plotted disaster against her. They said, ‘Come and let us destroy her as a nation. Madmen will also perish—a sword will go after you.’


## Jeremiah 48:3 (id: 924048003)

3Listen! A sound of screaming is coming from Horonaim, where there is ruin and great destruction.


## Jeremiah 48:4 (id: 924048004)

4Moab has been destroyed. Her children have made their cries heard.


## Jeremiah 48:5 (id: 924048005)

5They go up the hill of Luhith weeping, for on the way down to Horonaim, screams are heard because of the destruction.


## Jeremiah 48:6 (id: 924048006)

6Flee! Save your lives and become like a juniper bush in the wilderness.


## Jeremiah 48:7 (id: 924048007)

7For because of your trust in your practices and your wealth, you also will be captured. Then Chemosh will go away into captivity, together with his priests and leaders.


## Jeremiah 48:8 (id: 924048008)

8For the destroyer will come to every city; no city will escape. So the valley will perish and the plain will be devastated, as Yahweh has said.


## Jeremiah 48:9 (id: 924048009)

9Give wings to Moab, for she must certainly fly away. Her cities will become a wasteland, where there is no one to live in them.


## Jeremiah 48:10 (id: 924048010)

10May anyone who is lazy in doing Yahweh’s work be cursed! May anyone who keeps his sword back from shedding blood be cursed!


## Jeremiah 48:11 (id: 924048011)

11Moab has felt secure since he was young. He is like his wine that has never been poured from pot to pot. He has never gone into captivity. Therefore he tastes as good as ever; his flavor remains unchanged.


## Jeremiah 48:12 (id: 924048012)

12So see, the days are coming—this is Yahweh’s declaration—when I will send him those who will tip him over and pour out all his pots and shatter his jars.


## Jeremiah 48:13 (id: 924048013)

13Then Moab will be ashamed of Chemosh just as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel, their object of trust.


## Jeremiah 48:14 (id: 924048014)

14How can you say, ‘We are soldiers, powerful fighting men’?


## Jeremiah 48:15 (id: 924048015)

15Moab will be devastated and its cities attacked. For its finest young men have gone down to the place of slaughter. This is the king’s declaration! Yahweh of hosts is his name.


## Jeremiah 48:16 (id: 924048016)

16Moab’s disaster is soon to happen; calamity is hurrying quickly.


## Jeremiah 48:17 (id: 924048017)

17All you who are around Moab, wail; and all you who know its fame, shout this, ‘Woe, the strong staff, the honored rod, has been broken.’


## Jeremiah 48:18 (id: 924048018)

18Come down from your honored place and sit on the dry ground, you daughter living in Dibon. For the one who will destroy Moab is attacking you, the one who will destroy your strongholds.


## Jeremiah 48:19 (id: 924048019)

19Stand on the road and watch, you people who live in Aroer. Ask the ones who are fleeing and escaping. Say, ‘What has happened?’


## Jeremiah 48:20 (id: 924048020)

20Moab has been shamed, for it has been shattered. Howl and lament; shout for help. Tell it to people by the Arnon River that Moab has been devastated.


## Jeremiah 48:21 (id: 924048021)

21Now punishment has come to the hill country, to Holon, Jahzah, and Mephaath,


## Jeremiah 48:22 (id: 924048022)

22to Dibon, Nebo, and Beth Diblathaim,


## Jeremiah 48:23 (id: 924048023)

23to Kiriathaim, Beth Gamul, and Beth Meon,


## Jeremiah 48:24 (id: 924048024)

24To Kerioth and Bozrah, and to all the cities in the land of Moab— the farthest and the closest cities.


## Jeremiah 48:25 (id: 924048025)

25The horn of Moab has been hacked off; its arm has been broken—this is Yahweh’s declaration.


## Jeremiah 48:26 (id: 924048026)

26Make him drunk, because he acted proudly against Yahweh. Let Moab wallow in his vomit, and let him be an object of ridicule.


## Jeremiah 48:27 (id: 924048027)

27For did not Israel become an object for laughter to you? Was he found among thieves, so that you shook your head at him as often as you spoke about him?


## Jeremiah 48:28 (id: 924048028)

28Abandon the cities and camp on the cliffs, inhabitants of Moab. Become like a dove that is nesting over the mouth of a hole in the rocks.


## Jeremiah 48:29 (id: 924048029)

29We have heard of Moab’s pride—his arrogance, his haughtiness, his pride, his self\-glory and the conceit in his heart.


## Jeremiah 48:30 (id: 924048030)

30This is Yahweh’s declaration—I myself know his defiant speech, which amounts to nothing, like his deeds.


## Jeremiah 48:31 (id: 924048031)

31So I will howl a lament for Moab, and I will shout in sorrow for all of Moab. I will lament for the people of Kir Hareseth.


## Jeremiah 48:32 (id: 924048032)

32I will weep for you more than I did for Jazer, vine of Sibmah! Your branches passed across the Salt Sea and reached as far as Jazer. The destroyers have attacked your summer fruit and your wine.


## Jeremiah 48:33 (id: 924048033)

33So celebration and rejoicing have been taken away from the fruit trees and the land of Moab. I have put an end to the wine from their winepresses. They will not tread with joyful shouts. Any shouts will not be shouts of joy.


## Jeremiah 48:34 (id: 924048034)

34From the shouts at Heshbon as far as Elealeh, their sound is heard at Jahaz, from Zoar to Horonaim and Eglath Shelishiyah, since even the waters of Nimrim have dried up.


## Jeremiah 48:35 (id: 924048035)

35For I will put an end to anyone in Moab who makes sacrifices on the high places and burns incense to his gods—this is Yahweh’s declaration.


## Jeremiah 48:36 (id: 924048036)

36So my heart is lamenting for Moab like a flute. My heart is lamenting like flutes for the people of Kir Hareseth. The riches they gained are gone.


## Jeremiah 48:37 (id: 924048037)

37For every head is bald and every beard shaved. Incisions are on every hand, and sackcloth is around their waists.


## Jeremiah 48:38 (id: 924048038)

38There is mourning everywhere, on every flat roof of Moab and in Moab’s plazas. For I have destroyed Moab like pots that no one wants—this is Yahweh’s declaration.


## Jeremiah 48:39 (id: 924048039)

39How it has been shattered! How they howl in their lamenting! Moab turns its back in shame! So Moab will become an object of derision and a terror to all those who are around him.”


## Jeremiah 48:40 (id: 924048040)

40For Yahweh says this, “See, the enemy will come flying like an eagle, spreading out his wings over Moab.


## Jeremiah 48:41 (id: 924048041)

41Kerioth has been captured, and its strongholds have been seized. For in that day the hearts of Moab’s soldiers will be like the hearts of women in birth labor.


## Jeremiah 48:42 (id: 924048042)

42So Moab will be destroyed and be no longer a people, because he made himself to be great against Yahweh.


## Jeremiah 48:43 (id: 924048043)

43Terror and the pit, and a trap are coming on you, inhabitant of Moab—this is Yahweh’s declaration.


## Jeremiah 48:44 (id: 924048044)

44Anyone who flees because of terror will fall into the pit, and anyone who climbs out of the pit will be caught in the trap, for I will bring this on them in the year of my vengeance against them—this is Yahweh’s declaration.


## Jeremiah 48:45 (id: 924048045)

45The ones who flee will stand in the shadow of Heshbon without any strength, for fire will go out from Heshbon, flame from the middle of Sihon. It will devour the forehead of Moab and the top of the heads of the boastful people.


## Jeremiah 48:46 (id: 924048046)

46Woe to you, Moab! Chemosh’s people are destroyed, For your sons are taken as captives and your daughters into captivity.


## Jeremiah 48:47 (id: 924048047)

47But I will restore the fortunes of Moab in later days—this is Yahweh’s declaration.” The judgment on Moab ends here.


## Jeremiah 49:1 (id: 924049001)

1About the people of Ammon, Yahweh says this, “Does Israel have no children? Is there no one to inherit anything in Israel? Why does Molech occupy Gad, and his people live in its cities?


## Jeremiah 49:2 (id: 924049002)

2So look, the days are coming—this is Yahweh’s declaration—when I will sound the signal for battle against Rabbah among the people of Ammon, so it will become a deserted heap and its villages will be set on fire. For Israel will possess those who possessed him,” says Yahweh.


## Jeremiah 49:3 (id: 924049003)

3“Howl in lament, Heshbon, for Ai will be devastated! Shout out, daughters of Rabbah! Put on sackcloth. Lament and run about in futility, for Molech is going into captivity, together with his priests and leaders.


## Jeremiah 49:4 (id: 924049004)

4Why do you brag about your valleys, your valleys that are so fruitful, faithless daughter? you who trust in your wealth and say, ‘Who will come against me?’


## Jeremiah 49:5 (id: 924049005)

5See, I am about to bring terror on you—this is the declaration of Lord Yahweh of hosts— this terror will come from all those who surround you. Each one of you will be scattered before it. There will be no one to gather those running away.


## Jeremiah 49:6 (id: 924049006)

6But after this I will restore the fortunes of the people of Ammon—this is Yahweh’s declaration.”


## Jeremiah 49:7 (id: 924049007)

7About Edom, Yahweh of hosts says this, “Is there no longer any wisdom to be found in Teman? Has good advice disappeared from those who have understanding? Has their wisdom become corrupted?


## Jeremiah 49:8 (id: 924049008)

8Flee! Turn back! Stay in holes in the ground, inhabitants of Dedan. For I am bringing the disaster of Esau on him at the time that I punish him.


## Jeremiah 49:9 (id: 924049009)

9If grape harvesters came to you, would they not leave a little bit behind? If thieves came in the night, would they not steal only as much as they wanted?


## Jeremiah 49:10 (id: 924049010)

10But I have stripped Esau bare. I have revealed his hiding places. So he will not be able to hide himself. His children, his brothers, and his neighbors are destroyed, and he is gone.


## Jeremiah 49:11 (id: 924049011)

11Leave your orphans behind. I will take care of their lives, and your widows can trust in me.”


## Jeremiah 49:12 (id: 924049012)

12For Yahweh says this, “See, those who did not deserve it must certainly drink some of the cup. Do you yourself think you will go without punishment? You will not, for you will certainly drink.


## Jeremiah 49:13 (id: 924049013)

13For I have sworn by myself—this is Yahweh’s declaration—that Bozrah will become a horror, a disgrace, a devastation, and an object for cursing. All of its cities will become devastations forever.


## Jeremiah 49:14 (id: 924049014)

14I have heard news from Yahweh, and a messenger has been sent out to the nations, ‘Gather together and attack her. Get ready for battle.’


## Jeremiah 49:15 (id: 924049015)

15“For see, I have made you small compared to the other nations, despised by people.


## Jeremiah 49:16 (id: 924049016)

16As for your fearsomeness, your heart’s pride has deceived you, inhabitants of places on the cliff, you who have occupied the highest hills so that you may make your nest high like an eagle. I will bring you down from there—this is Yahweh’s declaration.


## Jeremiah 49:17 (id: 924049017)

17Edom will become a horror to everyone passing by it. Every such person will tremble and hiss because all of its disasters.


## Jeremiah 49:18 (id: 924049018)

18Like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighbors,” says Yahweh, “no one will live there; no person will stay there.


## Jeremiah 49:19 (id: 924049019)

19See, he will go up like a lion from the forests of the Jordan to the green pasturelands. For I will quickly make Edom run from it, and I will put someone who will be chosen in charge of it. For who is like me, and who will summon me? What shepherd is able to resist me?”


## Jeremiah 49:20 (id: 924049020)

20“So listen to the plans that Yahweh has decided against Edom, the plans that he has formed against the inhabitants of Teman. They will certainly be dragged away, even the smallest flock. Their pasturelands will be turned into ruined places.


## Jeremiah 49:21 (id: 924049021)

21At the sound of their falling the earth shakes. The sound of distressed shouts is heard at the Sea of Reeds.


## Jeremiah 49:22 (id: 924049022)

22See, someone will attack like an eagle, and swoop down and spread his wings over Bozrah. Then on that day, the hearts of Edom’s soldiers will become like the heart of a woman in birth labor.”


## Jeremiah 49:23 (id: 924049023)

23About Damascus: “Hamath and Arpad will be ashamed, for they have heard news of disaster. They melt away! They become as troubled as the sea, which cannot stay calm.


## Jeremiah 49:24 (id: 924049024)

24Damascus has become very weak. It turns away to flee; terror seizes it. Distress and pain seize it, like the pain of a woman giving birth.


## Jeremiah 49:25 (id: 924049025)

25How has the city of praise not been forsaken, the town of my joy?


## Jeremiah 49:26 (id: 924049026)

26Therefore its young men will fall in its plazas, and all the fighting men will perish on that day—this is the declaration of Yahweh of hosts.”

## Jeremiah 49:29 (id: 924049029)

29Their tents and their flocks will be taken, along with their tent curtains and all of their equipment; their camels will be led away from them, and men will shout to them, ‘Terror is on every side!’


## Jeremiah 49:30 (id: 924049030)

30Flee! Wander far away! Stay in holes in the ground, inhabitants of Hazor—this is Yahweh’s declaration— for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has devised a plan against you. Flee! Turn back!


## Jeremiah 49:31 (id: 924049031)

31Arise! Attack the nation at ease, that lives in safety,” says Yahweh. “They have no gates or bars in them, and its people live by themselves.


## Jeremiah 49:32 (id: 924049032)

32For their camels will become plunder, and the abundance of their property will become war plunder. Then I will scatter to every wind those who cut the corners of their hair, and I will bring disaster on them from every side—this is Yahweh’s declaration.


## Jeremiah 49:33 (id: 924049033)

33Hazor will become a lair of jackals, a permanent wasteland. No one will live there; no human being will stay there.”


## Jeremiah 49:34 (id: 924049034)

34This is the word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah the prophet about Elam. This happened at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, and he said,


## Jeremiah 49:35 (id: 924049035)

35“Yahweh of hosts says this: See, I am about to break the bowmen of Elam, the main part of their power.


## Jeremiah 49:36 (id: 924049036)

36For I will bring the four winds from the four corners of the heavens, and I will scatter the people of Elam to all of those winds. There is no nation to which those scattered from Elam will not go.


## Jeremiah 49:37 (id: 924049037)

## Jeremiah 49:38 (id: 924049038)

38Then I will put my throne in Elam and will destroy its king and leaders from there—this is Yahweh’s declaration—

39and it will happen in later days that I will bring back the fortunes of Elam—this is Yahweh’s declaration.”


## Jeremiah 50:1 (id: 924050001)

1This is the word that Yahweh declared about Babylon, the land of the Chaldeans, by the hand of Jeremiah the prophet,


## Jeremiah 50:2 (id: 924050002)

2“Report to the nations and cause them to listen. Lift up a signal and cause them to listen. Do not conceal it. Say, ‘Babylon is taken. Bel is made ashamed. Marduk is dismayed. Its idols are put to shame; its images are dismayed.’


## Jeremiah 50:3 (id: 924050003)

3A nation from the north will arise against it, and make her land a desolation. No one will live in it; both man and beast will flee away.

4In those days and at that time—this is Yahweh’s declaration—the people of Israel and the people of Judah will come together to go with weeping and seek Yahweh their God.

5They will ask the way to Zion and will set off toward it, saying, We will go and join ourselves to Yahweh in an everlasting covenant that will not be forgotten.”


## Jeremiah 50:6 (id: 924050006)

6My people have been a lost flock. Their shepherds have led them astray in the mountains; they have turned them around from hill to hill. They went, they forgot the place where they had lived.


## Jeremiah 50:7 (id: 924050007)

7Everyone who went out to them devoured them. Their adversaries said, ‘We are not guilty, because they sinned against Yahweh, their true home—Yahweh, the hope of their ancestors.’


## Jeremiah 50:8 (id: 924050008)

8Leave from the midst of Babylon; go out from the land of the Chaldeans; be like male goats that leave before the rest of the flock does.


## Jeremiah 50:9 (id: 924050009)

9For see, I am about to set in motion and raise up a group of great nations from the north against Babylon. They will arrange themselves against her. Babylon will be captured from there. Their arrows are like a skilled warrior who does not return empty\-handed.

10Chaldea will become plunder. All those who plunder it will be satisfied—this is Yahweh’s declaration.

11You rejoice, you celebrate the plundering of my inheritance; you jump around like a calf stamping in its pasture; you neigh like a powerful horse.


## Jeremiah 50:12 (id: 924050012)

12So your mother will be greatly ashamed; the one who bore you will be embarrassed. See, she will be the least of nations, a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.


## Jeremiah 50:13 (id: 924050013)

13Because of Yahweh’s anger, Babylon will not be inhabited, but will be a complete devastation. Everyone who passes by will shudder because of Babylon and will hiss because all of its wounds.


## Jeremiah 50:14 (id: 924050014)

14Arrange yourselves against Babylon all around her. Everyone who bends a bow must shoot at her. Do not keep back any of your arrows, for she has sinned against Yahweh.

## Jeremiah 50:16 (id: 924050016)

## Jeremiah 50:17 (id: 924050017)

17Israel is a sheep scattered and driven away by lions. First the king of Assyria devoured him; then after this, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon broke his bones.


## Jeremiah 50:18 (id: 924050018)

18Therefore Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, says this: See, I am about to punish the king of Babylon and his land, just as I punished the king of Assyria.


## Jeremiah 50:19 (id: 924050019)

19I will restore Israel to his homeland; he will graze on Carmel and Bashan. Then he will be satisfied in the hill country of Ephraim and Gilead.


## Jeremiah 50:20 (id: 924050020)

20In those days and at that time, says Yahweh, iniquity will be looked for in Israel, but none will be found. I will inquire about the sins of Judah, but none will be found, for I will forgive the remnant that I spare.”


## Jeremiah 50:21 (id: 924050021)

21“Arise against the land of Merathaim, against it and the ones inhabiting Pekod. Put them to the sword and set them apart for destruction—this is Yahweh’s declaration—do everything that I am commanding you.


## Jeremiah 50:22 (id: 924050022)

22The sounds of battle and enormous destruction are in the land.


## Jeremiah 50:23 (id: 924050023)

23How the hammer of all the lands has been cut apart and destroyed. How Babylon has become a destroyed place among the nations.


## Jeremiah 50:24 (id: 924050024)

24I have set a trap for you and you were taken, Babylon, and you did not know it! You were found and captured, because you opposed Yahweh.


## Jeremiah 50:25 (id: 924050025)

25Yahweh has opened his armory and is bringing out the weapons for carrying out his anger. There is work for the Lord Yahweh of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans.


## Jeremiah 50:26 (id: 924050026)

26Attack her from far away. Open her granaries and pile her up like heaps of grain. Set her apart for destruction. Leave no remnant of her.


## Jeremiah 50:27 (id: 924050027)

27Kill all her bulls. Send them down to the place of slaughter. Woe to them, for their day has come—the time for their punishment.


## Jeremiah 50:28 (id: 924050028)

28There is the sound of those fleeing, of those who are survivors, from the land of Babylon. These will report the vengeance of Yahweh our God for Zion, and vengeance for his temple.”


## Jeremiah 50:29 (id: 924050029)

29“Summon the archers against Babylon—all those who bend their bows. Camp against her, and let no one escape. Repay her for what she has done. Do to her by the measure she has used. For she had defied Yahweh, the Holy One of Israel.


## Jeremiah 50:30 (id: 924050030)

30So her young men will fall in the city squares, and all her fighting men will be destroyed on that day— this is Yahweh’s declaration.”


## Jeremiah 50:31 (id: 924050031)

31“See, I am against you, proud one—this is the declaration of the Lord Yahweh of hosts— for your day has come, proud one, the time when I will punish you.


## Jeremiah 50:32 (id: 924050032)

32So the proud ones will stumble and fall. No one will raise them up. I will light a fire in their cities; it will devour everything around him.


## Jeremiah 50:33 (id: 924050033)

33Yahweh of hosts says this: The people of Israel are oppressed, together with the people of Judah. All the ones who captured them still hold them; they refuse to let them go.


## Jeremiah 50:34 (id: 924050034)

34The one who rescues them is strong. Yahweh of hosts is his name. He will truly plead their case, in order to bring rest to the land, and to bring strife to the ones inhabiting Babylon.


## Jeremiah 50:35 (id: 924050035)

35A sword is against the Chaldeans—this is Yahweh’s declaration— and against the inhabitants of Babylon, her leaders, and her wise men.


## Jeremiah 50:36 (id: 924050036)

36A sword against those who say empty words! They will become fools! A sword against her soldiers! They will be filled with terror.


## Jeremiah 50:37 (id: 924050037)

37A sword is coming against their horses, their chariots and all of the people who are in the midst of Babylon, so they will become like women. A sword is coming against her storerooms, and they will be plundered.


## Jeremiah 50:38 (id: 924050038)

38A drought is coming on her waters, so they will become dry. For she is a land of worthless idols, and they act like people made insane by their dreadful idols.


## Jeremiah 50:39 (id: 924050039)

39So desert beasts with the jackals will inhabit there, and the young of ostriches will live in her. For all time, she will no longer be inhabited. From generation to generation, she will not be lived in.


## Jeremiah 50:40 (id: 924050040)

40Just as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighbors—this is Yahweh’s declaration— no one will live there; no person will stay in her.”


## Jeremiah 50:41 (id: 924050041)

41“See, a people is coming from the north; a great nation and many kings are being stirred up from the farthest parts of the earth.


## Jeremiah 50:42 (id: 924050042)

42They will pick up bows and spears. They are cruel and have no compassion. Their sound is like the sea roar, and they are riding on horses, set out in order as men for battle, against you, daughter of Babylon.


## Jeremiah 50:43 (id: 924050043)

43The king of Babylon heard the reports about them and his hands fell limp in distress. Anguish seized him like a woman giving birth.


## Jeremiah 50:44 (id: 924050044)

44Behold! He goes up like a lion from the heights of the Jordan to the enduring grazing place For I will quickly cause them to run from it, and I will put someone who will be chosen in charge of it. For who is like me, and who will summon me? What shepherd is able to resist me?


## Jeremiah 50:45 (id: 924050045)

45So listen to the plans that Yahweh has decided against Babylon, the plans that he has planned against the land of the Chaldeans. They will certainly be dragged away, even the smallest flock. Their pasturelands will be turned into ruined places.


## Jeremiah 50:46 (id: 924050046)

46At the sound of conquered Babylon the earth shakes, and their shout of distress is heard among the nations.”


## Jeremiah 51:1 (id: 924051001)

1“Yahweh says this: See, I am about to stir up a wind of destruction against Babylon and against those who live in Leb Kamai.


## Jeremiah 51:2 (id: 924051002)

2I will send foreigners to Babylon. They will scatter her and devastate her land, for they will come against her from all around on the day of disaster.


## Jeremiah 51:3 (id: 924051003)

3Do not let the archers bend their bows; do not let them put on armor. Do not spare her young men; set her whole army apart for destruction.


## Jeremiah 51:4 (id: 924051004)

4For the wounded people will fall in the land of the Chaldeans; those who are killed will fall in her streets.


## Jeremiah 51:5 (id: 924051005)

5For Israel and Judah are not forsaken by their God, by Yahweh of hosts, although their land is filled with offenses committed against the Holy One of Israel.


## Jeremiah 51:6 (id: 924051006)

6Flee from the midst of Babylon; let each man save himself. Do not perish in her iniquity. For it is the time of Yahweh’s vengeance. He will repay all of it to her.


## Jeremiah 51:7 (id: 924051007)

7Babylon was a golden cup in the hand of Yahweh that made all the world drunk; nations drank her wine and became insane.


## Jeremiah 51:8 (id: 924051008)

8Babylon will fall suddenly and be destroyed. Wail for her! Give her medicine for her pain; perhaps she can be healed.


## Jeremiah 51:9 (id: 924051009)

9‘We wished to heal Babylon, but she is not healed. Let us all leave her and go away, to our own land. For her guilt reaches up to the heavens; it is piled up to the clouds.


## Jeremiah 51:10 (id: 924051010)

10Yahweh has declared our innocence. Come, let us tell in Zion the deeds of Yahweh our God.’


## Jeremiah 51:11 (id: 924051011)

11Sharpen the arrows and take up the shields. Yahweh is stirring up the spirit of the king of the Medes in a plan to destroy Babylon. This is for Yahweh’s vengeance, vengeance for the destruction of his temple.


## Jeremiah 51:12 (id: 924051012)

12Lift up a banner over Babylon’s walls; make the watch strong; set up watchmen; prepare the ambushes; for the LORD will do what he has said concerning the inhabitants of Babylon.


## Jeremiah 51:13 (id: 924051013)

13You people who live by many streams of water, you people who are rich with treasures, your end has come. The thread of your life is now cut short.


## Jeremiah 51:14 (id: 924051014)

14Yahweh of hosts has sworn by his own life, ‘I will fill you with men, like a swarm of locusts, and they will raise a battle cry against you.’


## Jeremiah 51:15 (id: 924051015)

15He has made the earth by his power; he set in place the world by his wisdom. By his understanding he stretched out the heavens.


## Jeremiah 51:16 (id: 924051016)

16When he thunders, there is the roar of waters in the heavens, for he brings up the mist from the ends of the earth. He makes lightning for rain and sends out wind from his storehouses.


## Jeremiah 51:17 (id: 924051017)

17Every man has become ignorant, without knowledge. Every metalworker is put to shame by his idols. For his cast images are frauds, and there is no life in them.


## Jeremiah 51:18 (id: 924051018)

18They are useless, the work of mockers; they will perish at the time of their punishment.


## Jeremiah 51:19 (id: 924051019)

19But God, the portion of Jacob, is not like these, for he is the molder of all things. Israel is the tribe of his inheritance; Yahweh of hosts is his name.


## Jeremiah 51:20 (id: 924051020)

20You are my war hammer, my weapon for battle. With you I will smash nations and destroy kingdoms.


## Jeremiah 51:21 (id: 924051021)

21With you I will smash horses and their riders; with you I will smash chariots and their drivers.


## Jeremiah 51:22 (id: 924051022)

22With you I will smash each man and woman; with you I will smash the old and the young. With you I will smash the young men and the virgin girls.


## Jeremiah 51:23 (id: 924051023)

23With you I will smash the shepherds and their flocks; with you I will smash the plowmen and their teams. With you I will smash the governors and officials.


## Jeremiah 51:24 (id: 924051024)

24For in your sight I will pay Babylon and all the inhabitants of Chaldea for all of the evil that they did in Zion—this is Yahweh’s declaration.


## Jeremiah 51:25 (id: 924051025)

25See, I am against you, mountain of destruction—this is Yahweh’s declaration—which destroys the whole earth. I will stretch out my hand against you, and roll you down from the cliffs, and make you a burned\-out mountain.


## Jeremiah 51:26 (id: 924051026)

26So they will not take from you any stone to construct a building’s corner or foundation; for you will become an everlasting devastation—this is Yahweh’s declaration.


## Jeremiah 51:27 (id: 924051027)

27Lift up a banner over the earth. Blow the trumpet over the nations. Call the nations to attack her: Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz. Appoint a commander to attack her; bring up horses like swarming locusts.


## Jeremiah 51:28 (id: 924051028)

28Prepare the nations to attack her: The kings of the Medes and his governors, all of his officials and all the lands under his rule.


## Jeremiah 51:29 (id: 924051029)

29For the land will shake and be in anguish, since Yahweh’s plans continue against Babylon, to make the land of Babylon a wasteland where there is no inhabitant.


## Jeremiah 51:30 (id: 924051030)

30The soldiers in Babylon have stopped fighting; they stay in their strongholds. Their strength has failed; they have become women—her homes are on fire, the bars of her gates are broken.


## Jeremiah 51:31 (id: 924051031)

31A messenger runs to proclaim to another messenger, and a runner tells another runner to report to the king of Babylon that his city has been taken from end to end.


## Jeremiah 51:32 (id: 924051032)

32So the fords over the river are seized; the enemy is burning the reed marshes, and Babylon’s fighting men are confused.


## Jeremiah 51:33 (id: 924051033)

33For Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this: The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing floor. It is time to trample her down. In a little while the time of harvest will come to her.


## Jeremiah 51:34 (id: 924051034)

34‘Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has devoured me, he has driven me into confusion and has made me an empty pot. Like a monster he has swallowed me, he has filled his stomach with my delicious foods, and then he has spit me out.’


## Jeremiah 51:35 (id: 924051035)

35The one who lives in Zion will say, ‘May the violence done to me and my flesh be on Babylon.’ Jerusalem will say, ‘May my blood be on the inhabitants of Chaldea.’


## Jeremiah 51:36 (id: 924051036)

36Therefore Yahweh says this: See, I am about to plead your case and bring about vengeance for you. For I will dry up Babylon’s waters and make her springs run dry.


## Jeremiah 51:37 (id: 924051037)

37Babylon will become heaps of rubble, a den of jackals, a horror, an object of hissing, where there are no inhabitants.


## Jeremiah 51:38 (id: 924051038)

38The Babylonians will roar together like young lions. They will growl like lion cubs.


## Jeremiah 51:39 (id: 924051039)

39When they become hot with greed, I will make a feast for them; I will make them drunk so they become happy, and then sleep an unending sleep and not wake up—this is Yahweh’s declaration—


## Jeremiah 51:40 (id: 924051040)

40I will send them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with male goats.


## Jeremiah 51:41 (id: 924051041)

41How Babylon has been captured! So the praise of all the earth is seized. How Babylon has become a ruined place among the nations.


## Jeremiah 51:42 (id: 924051042)

42The sea has come up over Babylon! She is covered with its roaring waves.


## Jeremiah 51:43 (id: 924051043)

43Her cities have become a desolation, a dry land and a wilderness, a land that no one inhabits, and no human being passes through.


## Jeremiah 51:44 (id: 924051044)

44So I will punish Bel in Babylon; I will bring out from his mouth what he swallowed, and the nations will no longer flow to him with their offerings. The walls of Babylon will fall.


## Jeremiah 51:45 (id: 924051045)

45Go out from her midst, my people. Let each of you save his own life from the fury of my wrath.


## Jeremiah 51:46 (id: 924051046)

46Do not let your hearts be timid or fear the news that is heard in the land, for the news will come one year. After it in the next year there will be news, and violence will be in the land. Ruler will be against ruler.


## Jeremiah 51:47 (id: 924051047)

47Therefore, see, days are coming when I will punish the carved idols of Babylon. All of her land will be ashamed, and all of her slaughtered ones will fall in her midst.


## Jeremiah 51:48 (id: 924051048)

48Then the heavens and the earth, and all that is in them will rejoice over Babylon. For destroyers will come for her from the north—this is Yahweh’s declaration.


## Jeremiah 51:49 (id: 924051049)

49As Babylon has made the killed of Israel fall, so the killed of all her land will fall in Babylon.


## Jeremiah 51:50 (id: 924051050)

50Survivors of the sword, go away! Do not stay still. Call Yahweh to mind from far away; let Jerusalem come to mind.


## Jeremiah 51:51 (id: 924051051)

51We are ashamed, for we have heard insults; reproach has covered our faces, for foreigners have entered the holy places of Yahweh’s house.


## Jeremiah 51:52 (id: 924051052)

52Therefore, see, days are coming—this is Yahweh’s declaration—when I will punish her carved idols, and the wounded people will groan in all of her land.


## Jeremiah 51:53 (id: 924051053)

53For even if Babylon went up to the heavens or fortified her highest fortresses, destroyers would come from me to her—this is Yahweh’s declaration.


## Jeremiah 51:54 (id: 924051054)

54A shout of distress came from Babylon, a great collapse from the land of the Chaldeans.


## Jeremiah 51:55 (id: 924051055)

55For Yahweh is destroying Babylon. He is causing her loud voice to perish. Their enemies roar like the waves of many waters; their noise becomes very strong.


## Jeremiah 51:56 (id: 924051056)

56For the destroyers have come against her—against Babylon!—and her warriors have been captured. Their bows are broken, for Yahweh is the God of vengeance; he will surely carry out this repayment.


## Jeremiah 51:57 (id: 924051057)

57For I will make her princes, her sages, her officials, and her soldiers drunk, and they will sleep in an unending sleep and never wake up— this is the King’s declaration: Yahweh of hosts is his name.


## Jeremiah 51:58 (id: 924051058)

58Yahweh of hosts says this: The thick walls of Babylon will be completely demolished, and her high gates will be burned. Then the peoples coming to her aid will labor uselessly; everything that the nations try to do for her will be burned up.”


## Jeremiah 51:59 (id: 924051059)

59This is the word that Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah son of Neriah son of Mahseiah when he went with Zedekiah king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. Now Seraiah was a chief officer.


## Jeremiah 51:60 (id: 924051060)

60For Jeremiah had written in a scroll about all the disaster that was going to come on Babylon—all these words that were written about Babylon.


## Jeremiah 51:61 (id: 924051061)

61Jeremiah said to Seraiah, “When you go to Babylon, then you will see and you will read these words aloud.


## Jeremiah 51:62 (id: 924051062)

62Then you will say, ‘Yahweh, you yourself have declared that you would destroy this place, and that no man or animal will live in it, and it will be desolate forever.’


## Jeremiah 51:63 (id: 924051063)

63Then when you have finished reading this scroll, tie a stone to it and throw it into the middle of the Euphrates.


## Jeremiah 51:64 (id: 924051064)

64Say, ‘Babylon will sink like this. It will not arise because of the disaster that I am sending against it, and they will fall.’” Jeremiah’s words end here.


## Jeremiah 52:1 (id: 924052001)

1Zedekiah was twenty\-one years old when he began to reign; he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hamutal; she was the daughter of Jeremiah from Libnah.


## Jeremiah 52:2 (id: 924052002)

2He did what was evil in the sight of Yahweh; he did everything that Jehoiakim had done.


## Jeremiah 52:3 (id: 924052003)

3Through Yahweh’s anger, all these events happened in Jerusalem and Judah, until he drove them from before himself. Then Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.


## Jeremiah 52:4 (id: 924052004)

4It happened that in the ninth year of the reign of King Zedekiah, in the tenth month, and on the tenth day of the month, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came with all his army against Jerusalem. They camped opposite it, and they built a siege wall around it.


## Jeremiah 52:5 (id: 924052005)

5So the city was besieged until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah’s reign.


## Jeremiah 52:6 (id: 924052006)

6By the ninth day of the fourth month the famine was so severe in the city that there was no food for the people of the land.


## Jeremiah 52:7 (id: 924052007)

7Then the city was broken into, and all the fighting men fled and went out of the city at night by the way of the gate that was between the two walls, by the king’s garden, although the Chaldeans were all around the city. So they went in the direction of the Arabah.


## Jeremiah 52:8 (id: 924052008)

8But the army of Chaldeans pursued the king and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of the Jordan River valley near Jericho. All his army was scattered away from him.


## Jeremiah 52:9 (id: 924052009)

9They captured the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he passed sentence on him.


## Jeremiah 52:10 (id: 924052010)

10The king of Babylon slaughtered Zedekiah’s sons before his own eyes, and at Riblah he also slaughtered all the leaders of Judah.


## Jeremiah 52:11 (id: 924052011)

11Then he put out Zedekiah’s eyes, bound him in bronze chains, and brought him to Babylon. The king of Babylon put him in prison until the day of his death.


## Jeremiah 52:12 (id: 924052012)

12Now in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of the reign of King Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan came to Jerusalem. He was the commander of the king’s bodyguards and a servant of the king of Babylon.


## Jeremiah 52:13 (id: 924052013)

13He burned the house of Yahweh, the king’s palace, and all the houses of Jerusalem; also every important building in the city he burned.


## Jeremiah 52:14 (id: 924052014)

14As for the walls around Jerusalem, all the army of the Babylonians who were with the commander of the bodyguards destroyed them.


## Jeremiah 52:15 (id: 924052015)

15As for the poorest people, the rest of the people who were left in the city, those who had deserted to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the craftsmen— Nebuzaradan, the commander of the bodyguards, took some of them away into exile.


## Jeremiah 52:16 (id: 924052016)

16But Nebuzaradan, the commander of the bodyguards, left some of the poorest of the land to work the vineyards and fields.


## Jeremiah 52:17 (id: 924052017)

17As for the bronze pillars that belonged to the house of Yahweh, and the stands, and the large bronze basin called “The Sea” that were in the house of Yahweh, the Chaldeans broke them into pieces and carried all the bronze back to Babylon.


## Jeremiah 52:18 (id: 924052018)

18The pots, shovels, lamp trimmers, bowls, and all the utensils of bronze with which the priests had served in the temple—the Chaldeans took them all away.


## Jeremiah 52:19 (id: 924052019)

19The basins and the incense burners, the bowls, pots, lampstands, pans, and basins that were made of gold, and those made of silver—the commander of the king’s guard took them away as well.


## Jeremiah 52:20 (id: 924052020)

20The two pillars, the large bronze basin known as “The Sea,” and the twelve bronze bulls that were under the stands, things that Solomon had made for the house of Yahweh, contained more bronze than could be weighed.


## Jeremiah 52:21 (id: 924052021)

21The pillars were eighteen cubits high each, and a line around each one measured twelve cubits. Each was four fingers thick and hollow.


## Jeremiah 52:22 (id: 924052022)

22A capital of bronze was on top of it. The capital was five cubits high, with latticework and pomegranates all around. It was all made of bronze. The other pillar and its pomegranates were the same as the first.


## Jeremiah 52:23 (id: 924052023)

23So there were ninety\-six pomegranates on the capital’s sides, and one hundred pomegranates above the surrounding latticework.


## Jeremiah 52:24 (id: 924052024)

24The commander of the bodyguards took prisoner Seraiah, the high priest, together with Zephaniah, the second priest, and the three gatekeepers.


## Jeremiah 52:25 (id: 924052025)

25From the city he took prisoner an officer who was in charge of soldiers, and seven men of those who advised the king, who were still in the city. He also took prisoner the king’s army officer responsible for drafting men into the army, along with sixty important men from the land who were in the city.


## Jeremiah 52:26 (id: 924052026)

26Then Nebuzaradan, the commander of the bodyguards, took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.


## Jeremiah 52:27 (id: 924052027)

27The king of Babylon put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. In this way, Judah went out of its land into exile.


## Jeremiah 52:28 (id: 924052028)

28These were the people who Nebuchadnezzar exiled: In the seventh year, 3, 023 Judeans.


## Jeremiah 52:29 (id: 924052029)

29In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar he took 832 people from Jerusalem.


## Jeremiah 52:30 (id: 924052030)

30In the twenty\-third year of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan, the commander of the king’s bodyguards, exiled 745 Judean people. All the exiled people totaled 4, 600\.


## Jeremiah 52:31 (id: 924052031)

31It happened later in the thirty\-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin, king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty\-fifth day of the month, that Awel\-Marduk, king of Babylon released Jehoiachin king of Judah from prison. This happened in the year that Awel\-Marduk began to reign.


## Jeremiah 52:32 (id: 924052032)

32He spoke kindly to him and gave him a seat more honorable than that of the other kings who were with him in Babylon.


## Jeremiah 52:33 (id: 924052033)

33Awel\-Marduk removed Jehoiachin’s prison clothes, and Jehoiachin ate regularly at the king’s table for the rest of his life,


## Jeremiah 52:34 (id: 924052034)

34and a regular food allowance was given to him every day for the rest of his life until his death.
