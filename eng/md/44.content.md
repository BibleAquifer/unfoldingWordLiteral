## Acts 1:1 (id: 944001001)

1I made the first account, O Theophilus, about all that Jesus began both to do and to teach,


## Acts 1:2 (id: 944001002)

2until that day when he was taken up, having given commands through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen,


## Acts 1:3 (id: 944001003)

3to whom also, after he had suffered, he presented himself living with many proofs, appearing to them for 40 days and speaking things concerning the kingdom of God.


## Acts 1:4 (id: 944001004)

4And meeting together with them, he commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to await the promise of the Father, “which you heard from me,


## Acts 1:5 (id: 944001005)

5that John indeed baptized with water, but you will be baptized in the Holy Spirit after these not many days.”


## Acts 1:6 (id: 944001006)

6They therefore having assembled, they were asking him, saying, “Lord, if you are restoring the kingdom to Israel at this time?”


## Acts 1:7 (id: 944001007)

7But he said to them, “It is not for you to know the times or the seasons that the Father has set by his own authority.


## Acts 1:8 (id: 944001008)

8But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth.”


## Acts 1:9 (id: 944001009)

9And having said these things, as they were looking, he was raised up, and a cloud hid him from their eyes.


## Acts 1:10 (id: 944001010)

10And while they were looking intently into heaven as he was going up, and behold, two men stood by them in white clothes.


## Acts 1:11 (id: 944001011)

11And they said, “Men, Galileans, why do you stand looking into heaven? This Jesus, the one having been taken up from you into heaven, thus will come, the way you saw him going into heaven.”


## Acts 1:12 (id: 944001012)

12Then they returned to Jerusalem from the hill that is called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, having a journey of a Sabbath.


## Acts 1:13 (id: 944001013)

13And when they arrived, they went up into the upper chamber where they were staying, both Peter and John, and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot, and Judas of James.


## Acts 1:14 (id: 944001014)

14They all were continuing unanimously in prayer, with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus and with his brothers.


## Acts 1:15 (id: 944001015)

15And in those days Peter, having stood up in the midst of the brothers, said (and the multitude of names to the same was about 120\),


## Acts 1:16 (id: 944001016)

16“Men, brothers, it was necessary for the scripture to be fulfilled that the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, the one having become a guide to the ones arresting Jesus.


## Acts 1:17 (id: 944001017)

17For he was numbered with us and received a share of this ministry.”


## Acts 1:18 (id: 944001018)

18(Now indeed this one bought a field from the wage of unrighteousness, and having fallen headfirst, he burst open in the middle, and all his entrails were poured out.


## Acts 1:19 (id: 944001019)

19And it became known to all those living in Jerusalem. Therefore that field was called in their own language Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.)


## Acts 1:20 (id: 944001020)

20“For it is written in the book of Psalms, ‘Let his habitation become desolate, and let not one dwelling be in it,’ and ‘Let another take his overseership.’


## Acts 1:21 (id: 944001021)

21Therefore it is necessary, of the men having accompanied us during all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us,


## Acts 1:22 (id: 944001022)

22beginning from the baptism of John until the day on which he was taken up from us—one of these {is} to become a witness with us of his resurrection.”


## Acts 1:23 (id: 944001023)

23And they stood up two, Joseph, called Barsabbas, who was named Justus, and Matthias.


## Acts 1:24 (id: 944001024)

24And praying, they said, “You, Lord, heart\-knower of all, show which one from these two you have chosen


## Acts 1:25 (id: 944001025)

25to take this place of ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside to go to his own place.”


## Acts 1:26 (id: 944001026)

26And they cast lots for them, and the lot fell to Matthias, and he was chosen together with the 11 apostles.


## Acts 2:1 (id: 944002001)

1And when the day of Pentecost was completely filled, they were all together to the same.


## Acts 2:2 (id: 944002002)

2And suddenly a sound came from heaven, as of a strong wind being borne along, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.


## Acts 2:3 (id: 944002003)

3And tongues as if of fire appeared to them, distributing themselves, and they sat upon each one of them.


## Acts 2:4 (id: 944002004)

4And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they began to speak in other languages, as the Spirit was giving them to speak out.


## Acts 2:5 (id: 944002005)

5Now there were Jews living in Jerusalem, godly men, from every nation of those under heaven.


## Acts 2:6 (id: 944002006)

6And when this sound happened, the multitude came together and was confused, because each one was hearing them speaking in his own language.


## Acts 2:7 (id: 944002007)

7And they were all amazed and were marveling, saying, “Behold, are not all these who are speaking Galileans?


## Acts 2:8 (id: 944002008)

8And how are we hearing, each in our own language in which we were born?


## Acts 2:9 (id: 944002009)

9Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and those inhabiting Mesopotamia, Judea and also Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,


## Acts 2:10 (id: 944002010)

10Phrygia and also Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya that {are} near Cyrene, and Romans visiting,


## Acts 2:11 (id: 944002011)

11both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabians, we are hearing them speaking in our languages the great things of God.”


## Acts 2:12 (id: 944002012)

12So they were all amazed and were perplexed, saying one to another, “What does this want to be?”


## Acts 2:13 (id: 944002013)

13But others, mocking, were saying, “They are filled with sweet wine.”


## Acts 2:14 (id: 944002014)

14But Peter, having stood with the eleven, raised up his voice and spoke out to them, “Men, Jews, and all the ones inhabiting Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and take my words into your ears.


## Acts 2:15 (id: 944002015)

15For these are not drunk as you are assuming, for it is the third hour of the day.


## Acts 2:16 (id: 944002016)

16But this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel:


## Acts 2:17 (id: 944002017)

17‘“And it will be in the last days,” God says, “I will pour out from my Spirit on all flesh, and your sons and your daughters will prophesy and your young men will see visions and your old men will dream dreams.


## Acts 2:18 (id: 944002018)

18And even on my male servants and on my female servants in those days I will pour out from my Spirit, and they will prophesy.


## Acts 2:19 (id: 944002019)

19And I will give wonders in the heaven above and signs on the earth below, blood and fire and vapor of smoke.


## Acts 2:20 (id: 944002020)

20The sun will be turned to darkness, and the moon to blood before the great and remarkable day of the Lord comes.


## Acts 2:21 (id: 944002021)

21And it will be, everyone who may call on the name of the Lord will be saved.”’


## Acts 2:22 (id: 944002022)

22Men, Israelites, hear these words: Jesus the Nazarene {was} a man attested to you by God with mighty works and wonders and signs that God did through him in the midst of you, as you yourselves know.


## Acts 2:23 (id: 944002023)

23This one, given up by the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God, you killed by the hand of the lawless, having fastened,


## Acts 2:24 (id: 944002024)

24whom God raised up, having loosed the agonies of death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it.


## Acts 2:25 (id: 944002025)

25For David says about him, ‘I saw the Lord before me through all, for he is at my right so that I should not be moved.


## Acts 2:26 (id: 944002026)

26Because of this, my heart was glad and my tongue exulted. And indeed, my flesh will also dwell in hope.


## Acts 2:27 (id: 944002027)

27For you will not abandon my soul to Hades, nor will you allow your Holy One to see decay.


## Acts 2:28 (id: 944002028)

28You made known to me the paths of life; you will fill me with gladness with your face.’


## Acts 2:29 (id: 944002029)

29Men, brothers, it is possible to speak with confidence to you about the patriarch David, that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.


## Acts 2:30 (id: 944002030)

30Therefore, being a prophet and having known that God had sworn to him with an oath to set from the fruit of his loins upon his throne,


## Acts 2:31 (id: 944002031)

31having foreseen this, he spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that neither was he abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see decay.


## Acts 2:32 (id: 944002032)

32This Jesus, God has raised up, of which we all are witnesses.


## Acts 2:33 (id: 944002033)

33Therefore, having been exalted to the right of God and having received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, he has poured out this which you both see and hear.


## Acts 2:34 (id: 944002034)

34For David did not ascend to the heavens, but he himself says, ‘The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at my right


## Acts 2:35 (id: 944002035)

35until I make your enemies a stool for your feet.”’


## Acts 2:36 (id: 944002036)

36Therefore, let all the house of Israel know certainly that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.”


## Acts 2:37 (id: 944002037)

37And hearing this they were pierced in the heart, and they said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, “Men, brothers, what should we do?”


## Acts 2:38 (id: 944002038)

38Then Peter said to them, “Repent and each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.


## Acts 2:39 (id: 944002039)

39For the promise is to you and to your children and to all those {being} at a distance, as many as the Lord our God may call.”


## Acts 2:40 (id: 944002040)

40And with many other words he testified and urged them, saying, “Be saved from this perverse generation.”


## Acts 2:41 (id: 944002041)

41Therefore, having received his word, they were baptized, and about 3,000 souls were added in that day.


## Acts 2:42 (id: 944002042)

42And they were continuing in the teaching of the apostles and in fellowship, in the breaking of bread and in prayers.


## Acts 2:43 (id: 944002043)

43And fear was coming on every soul, and many wonders and signs were happening through the apostles.


## Acts 2:44 (id: 944002044)

44And all those believing were to the same and had all things in common,


## Acts 2:45 (id: 944002045)

45and they were selling properties and possessions and they were distributing them to all, as anyone might have need


## Acts 2:46 (id: 944002046)

46and, continuing unanimously every day in the temple and breaking bread in each house, they were sharing food with exultation and sincerity of heart,


## Acts 2:47 (id: 944002047)

47praising God and having favor with the whole people, and each day the Lord was adding the ones being saved to the same.


## Acts 3:1 (id: 944003001)

1Now Peter and John were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour.


## Acts 3:2 (id: 944003002)

2And a certain man, being lame from the womb of his mother, was being carried, whom each day they placed at the gate of the temple that is called Beautiful to ask for alms from those going into the temple,


## Acts 3:3 (id: 944003003)

3who, seeing Peter and John being about to enter into the temple, asked to receive alms.


## Acts 3:4 (id: 944003004)

4But Peter, looking intently at him with John, said, “Look at us.”


## Acts 3:5 (id: 944003005)

5So he paid attention to them, expecting to receive something from them.


## Acts 3:6 (id: 944003006)

6But Peter said, “Silver and gold I do not possess, but what I have, this I give to you. In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, walk.”


## Acts 3:7 (id: 944003007)

7And seizing him by the right hand, he raised him up, and immediately his feet and ankles were made strong.


## Acts 3:8 (id: 944003008)

8And leaping up, he stood and began to walk, and he entered with them into the temple, walking and leaping and praising God.


## Acts 3:9 (id: 944003009)

9And all the people saw him walking and praising God.


## Acts 3:10 (id: 944003010)

10And they recognized him, that he was the one sitting for alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple, and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.


## Acts 3:11 (id: 944003011)

11And as he was holding Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called Solomon’s, marveling.


## Acts 3:12 (id: 944003012)

12But Peter, seeing this, replied to the people, “Men, Israelites, why do you marvel at this? Or why do you look intently at us, as if we have made him to walk by our own power or godliness?


## Acts 3:13 (id: 944003013)

13The God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his Servant Jesus, whom you indeed delivered up and rejected before the face of Pilate, when that one had decided to release him.


## Acts 3:14 (id: 944003014)

14But you rejected the Holy and Righteous One, and asked for a man, a murderer, to be granted to you,


## Acts 3:15 (id: 944003015)

15and you killed the Originator of Life, whom God raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses.


## Acts 3:16 (id: 944003016)

16And by faith in his name, this one whom you see and know, his name has made strong. And the faith that {is} through him has given to him this complete health in the presence of all of you.


## Acts 3:17 (id: 944003017)

17And now, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance, as also your rulers.


## Acts 3:18 (id: 944003018)

18But what God foretold through the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ would suffer, he has fulfilled thus.


## Acts 3:19 (id: 944003019)

19Repent, therefore, and turn back for your sins to be wiped away,


## Acts 3:20 (id: 944003020)

20so that times of refreshment may come from the face of the Lord and he may send the one appointed for you, Christ Jesus,


## Acts 3:21 (id: 944003021)

21whom it is necessary for heaven to receive until the times of the restoration of all things, about which God spoke from the age through the mouth of his holy prophets.


## Acts 3:22 (id: 944003022)

22Moses indeed said, ‘The Lord our God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your brothers. You will listen to him according to everything—whatever he may speak to you.


## Acts 3:23 (id: 944003023)

23But it will be that every soul that does not listen to that prophet will be destroyed from the people.’


## Acts 3:24 (id: 944003024)

24And indeed, all the prophets from Samuel and those after him, as many as have spoken, have also announced these days.


## Acts 3:25 (id: 944003025)

25You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant that God made with your fathers, saying to Abraham, ‘And in your seed will all the families of the earth be blessed.’


## Acts 3:26 (id: 944003026)

26God, having raised up his Servant, sent him to you first, blessing you by turning each of you from your wickedness.”


## Acts 4:1 (id: 944004001)

1And as they were speaking to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came up to them,


## Acts 4:2 (id: 944004002)

2greatly troubled because they were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection that {is} from the dead.


## Acts 4:3 (id: 944004003)

3And they laid hands on them and put them in custody until the next day, since it was already evening.


## Acts 4:4 (id: 944004004)

4But many of the ones having heard the word believed, and the number of the men became about 5, 000\.


## Acts 4:5 (id: 944004005)

5And it happened that on the next day their rulers and elders and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem,


## Acts 4:6 (id: 944004006)

6and Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were from the high priestly family.


## Acts 4:7 (id: 944004007)

7And having set them in {their} midst, they asked them, “By what power or in what name have you done this?”


## Acts 4:8 (id: 944004008)

8Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, “Rulers of the people and elders,


## Acts 4:9 (id: 944004009)

9if we are being questioned today concerning a good deed to a sick man, by what means he was made well,


## Acts 4:10 (id: 944004010)

10let it be known to you all and to all the people of Israel that in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, by this one this {man} stands before you healthy.


## Acts 4:11 (id: 944004011)

11He is the stone that was rejected by you, the builders, which has become the head of the corner.


## Acts 4:12 (id: 944004012)

12And there is no salvation in anyone else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.”


## Acts 4:13 (id: 944004013)

13And seeing the boldness of Peter and John, and realizing that they were uneducated and ordinary men, they marveled, and they recognized them, that they had been with Jesus.


## Acts 4:14 (id: 944004014)

14But seeing the man who had been healed standing with them, they had nothing to say in opposition.


## Acts 4:15 (id: 944004015)

15But having commanded them to go outside the Sanhedrin, they conferred among themselves,


## Acts 4:16 (id: 944004016)

16saying, “What should we do to these men? For it is evident to everyone living in Jerusalem that a notable sign has happened through them, and we are not able to deny it.


## Acts 4:17 (id: 944004017)

17But so that it may not be spread unto more among the people, let us warn them no longer to speak in this name to any of men.”


## Acts 4:18 (id: 944004018)

18And summoning them, they commanded them neither to speak nor to teach at all in the name of Jesus.


## Acts 4:19 (id: 944004019)

19But answering, Peter and John said to them, “Whether it is right before God to listen to you rather than to God, you judge.


## Acts 4:20 (id: 944004020)

20For we are not able not to speak what we have seen and heard.”


## Acts 4:21 (id: 944004021)

21So, having warned them further, they released them, finding nothing for which they might punish them, on account of the people, for they were all glorifying God for what had happened.


## Acts 4:22 (id: 944004022)

22For the man to whom this sign of healing had happened was more than 40 years old.


## Acts 4:23 (id: 944004023)

23But having been released, they came to {their} own people and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them.


## Acts 4:24 (id: 944004024)

24And having heard, they raised their voice unanimously to God and said, “Lord, you {are} the one having made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that {is} in them,


## Acts 4:25 (id: 944004025)

25the one having said by the Holy Spirit from the mouth of our father David, your servant, ‘Why did the nations rage, and the peoples imagine useless things?


## Acts 4:26 (id: 944004026)

26The kings of the earth took their stand and the rulers were gathered to the same against the Lord and against his Christ.’


## Acts 4:27 (id: 944004027)

27For in truth both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the nations and the people of Israel, were gathered together in this city against your holy Servant Jesus, whom you anointed,


## Acts 4:28 (id: 944004028)

28to do all that your hand and your counsel had predetermined to happen.


## Acts 4:29 (id: 944004029)

29And now, Lord, look upon their threats and grant to your servants to speak your word with all boldness


## Acts 4:30 (id: 944004030)

30as you stretch out your hand to heal and for signs and wonders to happen through the name of your holy Servant Jesus.”


## Acts 4:31 (id: 944004031)

31And when they had prayed, the place in which they were gathered together was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they were speaking the word of God with boldness.


## Acts 4:32 (id: 944004032)

32Now the multitude of the ones having believed was one in heart and soul. And not one said that any of the things that were to him was his own, but everything was common to them.


## Acts 4:33 (id: 944004033)

33And with great power the apostles were proclaiming the testimony of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all.


## Acts 4:34 (id: 944004034)

34For there was not anyone needy among them, for as many as were owners of lands or houses, selling them, were bringing the price of the things being sold


## Acts 4:35 (id: 944004035)

35and they were laying it at the feet of the apostles, and it was being distributed to each one, according as anyone had need.


## Acts 4:36 (id: 944004036)

36Then Joseph, called Barnabas by the apostles (which, being translated, is Son of Encouragement), a Levite from Cyprus by birth,


## Acts 4:37 (id: 944004037)

37selling a field that was to him, brought the money and laid it at the feet of the apostles.


## Acts 5:1 (id: 944005001)

1Now a certain man, Ananias by name, with Sapphira his wife, sold a piece of land,


## Acts 5:2 (id: 944005002)

2and he kept back from the price, {his} wife also knowing, and bringing a certain portion, he laid it at the feet of the apostles.


## Acts 5:3 (id: 944005003)

3But Peter said, “Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart for you to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back from the price of the land?


## Acts 5:4 (id: 944005004)

4While it remained, did it not remain yours, and being sold, was it {not} in your authority? How {is it} that you placed this thing in your heart? You have not lied to men, but to God.”


## Acts 5:5 (id: 944005005)

5And hearing these words, Ananias, falling down, expired, and great fear came upon all the ones having heard.


## Acts 5:6 (id: 944005006)

6So rising up, the young men wrapped him up and, carrying him out, they buried him.


## Acts 5:7 (id: 944005007)

7And an interval of about three hours happened, and his wife, not knowing what had happened, came in.


## Acts 5:8 (id: 944005008)

8And Peter said to her, “Tell me whether you sold the land for so much.” And she said, “Yes, for so much.”


## Acts 5:9 (id: 944005009)

9So Peter said to her, “How {is it} that it was agreed together by you to test the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, the feet of the ones having buried your husband {are} at the door, and they will carry you out.”


## Acts 5:10 (id: 944005010)

10And immediately she fell down at his feet and expired. And having come in, the young men found her dead, and carrying her out, they buried her beside her husband.


## Acts 5:11 (id: 944005011)

11And great fear came upon the whole church and upon all the ones hearing these things.


## Acts 5:12 (id: 944005012)

12And many signs and wonders were happening through the hands of the apostles among the people, and they were all unanimously at the Porch of Solomon.


## Acts 5:13 (id: 944005013)

13But none of the others dared to join them; however, the people extolled them.


## Acts 5:14 (id: 944005014)

14And more believers were being added to the Lord, multitudes of both men and of women,


## Acts 5:15 (id: 944005015)

15so that they even carried the sick into the streets and laid them on cots and mats, so that as Peter came by, at least {his} shadow might overshadow any one of them.


## Acts 5:16 (id: 944005016)

16And a multitude also came together from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing the sick and those afflicted by unclean spirits, who were all healed.


## Acts 5:17 (id: 944005017)

17But rising up, the high priest and all those with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees) were filled with jealousy,


## Acts 5:18 (id: 944005018)

18and they laid hands on the apostles and put them in the public prison.


## Acts 5:19 (id: 944005019)

19But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the prison, bringing them out, and said,


## Acts 5:20 (id: 944005020)

20“Go and, standing in the temple, speak to the people all the words of this life.”


## Acts 5:21 (id: 944005021)

21And having heard this, they entered into the temple about daybreak and were teaching. And having arrived, the high priest and those with him called together the Sanhedrin, even all the elders of the sons of Israel, and sent to the prison to bring the apostles.


## Acts 5:22 (id: 944005022)

22But having arrived, the officers did not find them in the prison, so having returned, they reported,


## Acts 5:23 (id: 944005023)

23saying, “We found the prison shut in all security and the guards standing at the doors, but having opened, we found no one inside.”


## Acts 5:24 (id: 944005024)

24And when both the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these words, they were perplexed concerning them, as to what this might become.


## Acts 5:25 (id: 944005025)

25Then someone, having arrived, reported to them, “Behold, the men whom you put in the prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people.”


## Acts 5:26 (id: 944005026)

26Then the captain, going with the officers, brought them back, not with violence, for they feared the people, lest they stone them.


## Acts 5:27 (id: 944005027)

27And having brought them, they set them in the Sanhedrin, and the high priest interrogated them,


## Acts 5:28 (id: 944005028)

28saying, “We commanded you with a command not to teach in this name, and behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and you desire to bring upon us the blood of this man.”


## Acts 5:29 (id: 944005029)

29But answering, Peter and the apostles said, “It is necessary to obey God rather than men.


## Acts 5:30 (id: 944005030)

30The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you killed, having hung him on a tree.


## Acts 5:31 (id: 944005031)

31God has exalted this one to his right as Prince and Savior, to give repentance and forgiveness of sins to Israel.


## Acts 5:32 (id: 944005032)

32And we are witnesses of these things, and the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those obeying him.”


## Acts 5:33 (id: 944005033)

33But having heard this, they were furious and wanted to kill them.


## Acts 5:34 (id: 944005034)

34But a certain Pharisee, Gamaliel by name, a law teacher, honored by all the people, rising up in the Sanhedrin, commanded to put the apostles outside for a little.


## Acts 5:35 (id: 944005035)

35And he said to them, “Men, Israelites, pay attention to yourselves, what you are about to do to these men.


## Acts 5:36 (id: 944005036)

36For before these days, Theudas rose up, saying himself to be somebody, to whom was joined a number of men, about 400, who was killed, and all, as many as were persuaded by him, were dispersed, and they came to nothing.


## Acts 5:37 (id: 944005037)

37After this one, Judas the Galilean rose up in the days of the census and drew away people after him. That one also perished, and all, as many as were persuaded by him, were scattered.


## Acts 5:38 (id: 944005038)

38And now I say these things to you: Keep away from these men and release them, for if this counsel or this work is from men, it will be destroyed,


## Acts 5:39 (id: 944005039)

39but if it is from God, you will not be able to destroy them, lest you may even be found God\-opposers.” And they were persuaded by him.


## Acts 5:40 (id: 944005040)

40And summoning the apostles, having beaten them, they commanded them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and they released them.


## Acts 5:41 (id: 944005041)

41Therefore, they indeed were going out from the face of the Sanhedrin rejoicing that they had been considered worthy to suffer dishonor for the Name.


## Acts 5:42 (id: 944005042)

42And every day, in the temple and in each house, they did not cease teaching and proclaiming the gospel—Jesus {is} the Christ.


## Acts 6:1 (id: 944006001)

1Now in those days, when the disciples were multiplying, a complaint by the Hellenists happened against the Hebrews, because their widows were being overlooked in the daily serving.


## Acts 6:2 (id: 944006002)

2So summoning the multitude of the disciples, the Twelve said, “It is not acceptable for us to leave behind the word of God to serve tables.


## Acts 6:3 (id: 944006003)

3So brothers, choose from among yourselves seven men of good reputation, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may appoint over this task.


## Acts 6:4 (id: 944006004)

4But we will continue in prayer and in the ministry of the word.”


## Acts 6:5 (id: 944006005)

5And the statement was pleasing before the whole multitude. So they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte from Antioch.


## Acts 6:6 (id: 944006006)

6They brought them before the apostles, and having prayed, they placed their hands upon them.


## Acts 6:7 (id: 944006007)

7So the word of God kept spreading, and the number of disciples in Jerusalem increased greatly, and a large crowd of the priests became obedient to the faith.


## Acts 6:8 (id: 944006008)

8Now Stephen, full of grace and power, was doing great wonders and signs among the people.


## Acts 6:9 (id: 944006009)

9But there arose some people, the ones from the synagogue that is called Freedmen, and of the Cyrenians, and of the Alexandrians, and of those from Cilicia and Asia. They were debating with Stephen.


## Acts 6:10 (id: 944006010)

10But they were not able to stand against the wisdom and the Spirit by whom he spoke.


## Acts 6:11 (id: 944006011)

11Then they bribed men to say, “We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God.”


## Acts 6:12 (id: 944006012)

12They also stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes, and approaching him, they seized him and brought him to the Sanhedrin.


## Acts 6:13 (id: 944006013)

13And they brought false witnesses, saying, “This man does not stop speaking words against the holy place and the law.


## Acts 6:14 (id: 944006014)

14For we have heard him say that this Jesus the Nazarene will destroy this place and change the customs that Moses handed down to us.”


## Acts 6:15 (id: 944006015)

15And looking intently at him, everyone sitting in the Sanhedrin saw his face as the face of an angel.


## Acts 7:1 (id: 944007001)

1Then the high priest said, “Are these things thus?”


## Acts 7:2 (id: 944007002)

2Then he said, “Men, brothers and fathers, listen to me: The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, even before he lived in Haran;


## Acts 7:3 (id: 944007003)

3and he said to him, ‘Go out from your land and from your relatives, and come into the land that I will show you.’


## Acts 7:4 (id: 944007004)

4Then going out from the land of the Chaldeans, he lived in Haran. And from there, after the death of his father, he brought him into this land, in which you live now.


## Acts 7:5 (id: 944007005)

5But he did not give him an inheritance in it—not even a footstep. But he promised to give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him—although he did not have a child.


## Acts 7:6 (id: 944007006)

6But God spoke to him like this, that his seed would be a stranger in a foreign land, and that they would enslave him and treat him badly for 400 years.


## Acts 7:7 (id: 944007007)

7‘But I will judge the nation that will enslave him,’ said God, ‘and after that they will come out and serve me in this place.’


## Acts 7:8 (id: 944007008)

8And he gave him the covenant of circumcision, and so he fathered Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day; and Isaac, Jacob; and Jacob, the 12 patriarchs.


## Acts 7:9 (id: 944007009)

9And the patriarchs, envying Joseph, sold him into Egypt. But God was with him


## Acts 7:10 (id: 944007010)

10and he rescued him from all his afflictions, and he gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and he appointed him governor over Egypt and all his household.


## Acts 7:11 (id: 944007011)

11Then came a famine over all Egypt and Canaan, and great tribulation, and our fathers did not find food.


## Acts 7:12 (id: 944007012)

12But having heard there was grain in Egypt, Jacob sent our fathers first.


## Acts 7:13 (id: 944007013)

13And during the second {time}, Joseph was made known to his brothers, and the family of Joseph became known to Pharaoh.


## Acts 7:14 (id: 944007014)

14Then, sending them back, Joseph summoned Jacob, his father, and all {his} relatives, in souls 75\.


## Acts 7:15 (id: 944007015)

15So Jacob went down to Egypt, and he and our fathers died.


## Acts 7:16 (id: 944007016)

16And they were carried over to Shechem and laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a price in silver from the sons of Hamor in Shechem.


## Acts 7:17 (id: 944007017)

17And as the time of the promise that God had sworn to Abraham approached, the people increased and multiplied in Egypt,


## Acts 7:18 (id: 944007018)

18until another king arose over Egypt who did not know Joseph.


## Acts 7:19 (id: 944007019)

19He, exploiting our people, mistreated {our} fathers, to make their babies exposed, in order not to keep them alive.


## Acts 7:20 (id: 944007020)

20At that time Moses was born, and he was beautiful to God. He was raised for three months in the house of {his} father.


## Acts 7:21 (id: 944007021)

21But when he was exposed, the daughter of Pharaoh took him up and raised him for herself as a son.


## Acts 7:22 (id: 944007022)

22And Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was mighty in his words and works.


## Acts 7:23 (id: 944007023)

23But when a 40\-year time was filled to him, it came up on his heart to visit his brothers, the sons of Israel.


## Acts 7:24 (id: 944007024)

24And seeing a certain one being mistreated, he defended him and made vengeance for the one being oppressed, striking the Egyptian:


## Acts 7:25 (id: 944007025)

25and he was thinking {his} brothers would understand that God was giving salvation to them by his hand, but they did not understand.


## Acts 7:26 (id: 944007026)

26And on the next day he appeared to them as they were quarreling, and he urged them to peace, saying, ‘Men, you are brothers. Why is it that you are hurting each other?’


## Acts 7:27 (id: 944007027)

27But the one injuring {his} neighbor pushed him away, saying, ‘Who appointed you a ruler and a judge over us?


## Acts 7:28 (id: 944007028)

28You do not want to kill me the way you killed the Egyptian yesterday, do you?’


## Acts 7:29 (id: 944007029)

29Then Moses ran away at this word, and he became a foreigner in the land of Midian, where he fathered two sons.


## Acts 7:30 (id: 944007030)

30And 40 years having been filled, an angel appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai, in a flame of fire in a bush.


## Acts 7:31 (id: 944007031)

31And Moses, seeing it, admired the sight; and as he approached to look, the voice of the Lord came:


## Acts 7:32 (id: 944007032)

32‘I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob.’ And Moses, becoming terrified, did not dare to look.


## Acts 7:33 (id: 944007033)

33And the Lord said to him, ‘Untie the sandal of your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground.


## Acts 7:34 (id: 944007034)

34I have certainly seen the oppression of my people who {are} in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and I have come down to rescue them. And now come, let me send you to Egypt.’


## Acts 7:35 (id: 944007035)

35This Moses, whom they rejected, saying, ‘Who appointed you a ruler and a judge?’—this one God sent as both a ruler and a redeemer with the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush.


## Acts 7:36 (id: 944007036)

36This one led them out, doing wonders and signs in the land of Egypt and at the Red Sea, and in the wilderness during 40 years.


## Acts 7:37 (id: 944007037)

37This is the Moses who said to the sons of Israel, ‘God will raise up a prophet like me for you from your brothers.’


## Acts 7:38 (id: 944007038)

38This is the one having been in the assembly in the wilderness with the angel {who was} speaking to him on Mount Sinai, and with our fathers, who received living words to give to us,


## Acts 7:39 (id: 944007039)

39to whom our fathers were not willing to be obedient; instead, they pushed him away and turned back in their hearts to Egypt,


## Acts 7:40 (id: 944007040)

40saying to Aaron, ‘Make for us gods who will go ahead of us. For this Moses, who brought us from the land of Egypt, we do not know what has happened to him.’


## Acts 7:41 (id: 944007041)

41So they made an image of a calf in those days and brought a sacrifice to the idol and rejoiced in the works of their hands.


## Acts 7:42 (id: 944007042)

42But God turned away and abandoned them to serve the host of heaven, as it is written in the book of the prophets, ‘You did not offer slain beasts and offerings to me for 40 years in the wilderness, did you, O house of Israel?


## Acts 7:43 (id: 944007043)

43And you took up the tabernacle of Molech and the star of your god Rephan— the images that you made to worship them— and I will remove you beyond Babylon.’


## Acts 7:44 (id: 944007044)

44The tabernacle of the testimony was with our fathers in the wilderness, just as the one speaking to Moses had commanded, to make it according to the pattern that he had seen,


## Acts 7:45 (id: 944007045)

45which also our fathers, having received it in turn, brought in with Joshua in the possessing of the nations that God drove out from the face of our fathers, until the days of David,


## Acts 7:46 (id: 944007046)

46who found favor before God, and he asked to find a dwelling for the house of Jacob.


## Acts 7:47 (id: 944007047)

47However, Solomon built the house for him.


## Acts 7:48 (id: 944007048)

48But the Most High does not live in {houses} made with hands, as the prophet says,


## Acts 7:49 (id: 944007049)

49‘Heaven {is} my throne, and the earth {is} the footstool for my feet. What kind of house will you build for me? says the Lord, or what {is} the place for my rest?


## Acts 7:50 (id: 944007050)

50Did my hand not make all these things?’


## Acts 7:51 (id: 944007051)

51O stiff\-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears! You always resist the Holy Spirit! As your fathers, also you.


## Acts 7:52 (id: 944007052)

52Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? And they killed the ones foretelling about the coming of the Righteous One, whose betrayers and murderers you have now become,


## Acts 7:53 (id: 944007053)

53who received the law by directions of angels, but did not keep it.”


## Acts 7:54 (id: 944007054)

54Now hearing these things, they were cut to their hearts, and they ground {their} teeth at him.


## Acts 7:55 (id: 944007055)

55But being full of the Holy Spirit, looking intently into heaven, he saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right of God.


## Acts 7:56 (id: 944007056)

56And he said, “Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing at the right of God.”


## Acts 7:57 (id: 944007057)

57But shouting with a loud voice, they covered their ears and rushed at him unanimously.


## Acts 7:58 (id: 944007058)

58And throwing him outside the city, they stoned him. And the witnesses laid aside their outer garments at the feet of a young man named Saul.


## Acts 7:59 (id: 944007059)

59And they were stoning Stephen as he was calling out and saying, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.”


## Acts 7:60 (id: 944007060)

60But having put down {his} knees, he cried out with a loud voice, “Lord, do not hold this sin against them.” And having said this, he fell asleep.


## Acts 8:1 (id: 944008001)

1And Saul was agreeing with his execution. And on that day a great persecution began against the church that {was} in Jerusalem, and they all were scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.


## Acts 8:2 (id: 944008002)

2And devout men carried away Stephen and made great lamentation over him.


## Acts 8:3 (id: 944008003)

3But Saul was harming the church. Entering by houses, dragging out both men and women, he was delivering them to prison.


## Acts 8:4 (id: 944008004)

4Then the ones having been scattered went about proclaiming the word.


## Acts 8:5 (id: 944008005)

5And Philip, going down to the city of Samaria, was proclaiming Christ to them.


## Acts 8:6 (id: 944008006)

6And the crowds were paying attention unanimously to the things being spoken by Philip when they heard them and saw the signs that he was doing.


## Acts 8:7 (id: 944008007)

7For many of those having unclean spirits, shouting with a loud voice, they were coming out. And many paralyzed and lame were healed.


## Acts 8:8 (id: 944008008)

8And there was much joy in that city.


## Acts 8:9 (id: 944008009)

9But a certain man, Simon by name, was already practicing sorcery in the city and astonishing the people of Samaria, saying himself to be someone great,


## Acts 8:10 (id: 944008010)

10to whom they all, from little to great, were paying attention, saying, “This is the power of God that is called Great.”


## Acts 8:11 (id: 944008011)

11And they were paying attention to him because for a long time he had amazed them with sorceries.


## Acts 8:12 (id: 944008012)

12But when they believed Philip, proclaiming the gospel about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were being baptized, both men and women.


## Acts 8:13 (id: 944008013)

13And Simon himself also believed and, having been baptized, he was continuing with Philip. And seeing great signs and works happening, he marveled.


## Acts 8:14 (id: 944008014)

14And the apostles in Jerusalem, having heard that Samaria had received the word of God, sent to them Peter and John,


## Acts 8:15 (id: 944008015)

15who, having come down, prayed for them, so that they might receive the Holy Spirit.


## Acts 8:16 (id: 944008016)

16For he had not yet fallen upon any of them, but they had only been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.


## Acts 8:17 (id: 944008017)

17Then they were laying {their} hands on them, and they were receiving the Holy Spirit.


## Acts 8:18 (id: 944008018)

18And Simon, seeing that the Spirit was being given through the laying on of the hands of the apostles, offered them money,


## Acts 8:19 (id: 944008019)

19saying, “Give to me also this authority, so that on whomever I lay {my} hands, he may receive the Holy Spirit.”


## Acts 8:20 (id: 944008020)

20But Peter said to him, “May your silver be with you unto destruction, because you thought to obtain the gift of God through money!


## Acts 8:21 (id: 944008021)

21No part or share in this matter is to you, because your heart is not right before God.


## Acts 8:22 (id: 944008022)

22Therefore repent of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord, if therefore the intention of your heart will be forgiven to you.


## Acts 8:23 (id: 944008023)

23For I see you being in the gall of bitterness and the bond of unrighteousness.”


## Acts 8:24 (id: 944008024)

24But answering, Simon said, “You pray to the Lord for me, so that nothing of which you have spoken may come upon me.”


## Acts 8:25 (id: 944008025)

25Then the ones having testified and having spoken the word of the Lord were returning to Jerusalem and proclaiming the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans.


## Acts 8:26 (id: 944008026)

26Now an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, “Arise and go toward the south on the road going down from Jerusalem to Gaza.” (This is desert.)


## Acts 8:27 (id: 944008027)

27And arising, he went, and behold, a man, an Ethiopian, a eunuch, an official of the Kandake, the queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure, who had come to Jerusalem to worship,


## Acts 8:28 (id: 944008028)

28and he was returning and sitting in his chariot, and he was reading the prophet Isaiah.


## Acts 8:29 (id: 944008029)

29And the Spirit said to Philip, “Approach and join this chariot.”


## Acts 8:30 (id: 944008030)

30So having run to him, Philip heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and he said, “Do you understand what you are reading?”


## Acts 8:31 (id: 944008031)

31And he said, “For how would I be able, unless someone will guide me?” And he invited Philip to sit with him, having come up.


## Acts 8:32 (id: 944008032)

32Now the passage of Scripture that he was reading was this: “He was led like a sheep to the slaughter, and like a lamb before its shearer {is} silent, thus he does not open his mouth.


## Acts 8:33 (id: 944008033)

33In humiliation his justice was taken away. Who will describe his generation? For his life is taken from the earth.”


## Acts 8:34 (id: 944008034)

34And answering, the eunuch said to Philip, “I beg of you, about whom is the prophet saying this—about himself, or about some other?”


## Acts 8:35 (id: 944008035)

35And Philip, opening his mouth and beginning with this scripture, proclaimed Jesus to him.


## Acts 8:36 (id: 944008036)

36And as they were going along the road, they came to some water and the eunuch says, “Behold, water! What is preventing my being baptized?”


## Acts 8:37 (id: 944008037)

37\[And Philip said to him, “If you believe from your whole heart, you will be saved.” And answering he said, “I believe in Christ, the Son of God.”]


## Acts 8:38 (id: 944008038)

38And he commanded the chariot to stop, and they both went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him.


## Acts 8:39 (id: 944008039)

39And when they came up from the water, the Spirit of the Lord snatched Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him anymore, for he went on his way rejoicing.


## Acts 8:40 (id: 944008040)

40But Philip was found at Azotus and, passing through, he was proclaiming the gospel to all the cities until he came to Caesarea.


## Acts 9:1 (id: 944009001)

1But Saul, still breathing threat and murder against the disciples of the Lord, going to the high priest,


## Acts 9:2 (id: 944009002)

2requested letters from him to Damascus, to the synagogues, so that if he found any being of the Way, both men and women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.


## Acts 9:3 (id: 944009003)

3And as he was traveling, it happened that he came near to Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven surrounded him;


## Acts 9:4 (id: 944009004)

4and, falling to the ground, he heard a voice saying to him, “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?”


## Acts 9:5 (id: 944009005)

5And he said, “Who are you, Lord?” And he {said}, “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting;


## Acts 9:6 (id: 944009006)

6but get up and enter into the city, and it will be told to you what thing it is necessary for you to do.”


## Acts 9:7 (id: 944009007)

7But the men traveling with him stood speechless, hearing the voice but seeing no one.


## Acts 9:8 (id: 944009008)

8And Saul rose up from the ground, but his eyes being opened, he was seeing nothing. But leading him by the hand, they brought him into Damascus.


## Acts 9:9 (id: 944009009)

9And he was not seeing for three days, and he neither ate nor drank.


## Acts 9:10 (id: 944009010)

10Now there was a certain disciple in Damascus named Ananias. And the Lord said to him in a vision, “Ananias!” And he said, “Behold, I, Lord.”


## Acts 9:11 (id: 944009011)

11And the Lord {said} to him, “Arising, go to the street called Straight, and in the house of Judas seek Saul by name, from Tarsus, for behold, he is praying,


## Acts 9:12 (id: 944009012)

12and in a vision he has seen a man, Ananias by name, coming in and laying hands on him so that he might see again.”


## Acts 9:13 (id: 944009013)

13But Ananias answered, “Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how many evils he has done to your saints in Jerusalem.


## Acts 9:14 (id: 944009014)

14And here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all the ones calling upon your name.”


## Acts 9:15 (id: 944009015)

15But the Lord said to him, “Go, for this is to me an instrument of choosing, to carry my name before the nations, and also kings, and the sons of Israel;


## Acts 9:16 (id: 944009016)

16for I will show him how much it is necessary for him to suffer for my name.”


## Acts 9:17 (id: 944009017)

17And Ananias departed, and entered into the house. And having laid {his} hands on him, he said, “Saul, brother, the Lord has sent me—Jesus, the one having appeared to you on the road on which you were going—so that you might see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit.”


## Acts 9:18 (id: 944009018)

18And immediately {something} like scales fell from his eyes, and he saw again, and rising up, he was baptized;


## Acts 9:19 (id: 944009019)

19and having taken food, he was strengthened. And he was with the disciples in Damascus for some days.


## Acts 9:20 (id: 944009020)

20And immediately in the synagogues he proclaimed Jesus, that this is the Son of God.


## Acts 9:21 (id: 944009021)

21And all the ones hearing were marveling and were saying, “Is not this the one having destroyed in Jerusalem the ones calling on this name? And he had come here for this, that he might bring them bound to the chief priests?”


## Acts 9:22 (id: 944009022)

22But Saul was becoming more powerful and stirring up the Jews living in Damascus, proving that Jesus is the Christ.


## Acts 9:23 (id: 944009023)

23But when many days were filled, the Jews took counsel together to kill him.


## Acts 9:24 (id: 944009024)

24But their plot became known to Saul. But they were even watching the gates both day and night in order to kill him.


## Acts 9:25 (id: 944009025)

25But his disciples, taking him by night, let him down through the wall, lowering him in a basket.


## Acts 9:26 (id: 944009026)

26And having come to Jerusalem, he was attempting to join the disciples, but they were all fearing him, not believing that he was a disciple.


## Acts 9:27 (id: 944009027)

27But taking hold of him, Barnabas brought him to the apostles and told them how he had seen the Lord on the road and that he had spoken to him, and how in Damascus he had spoken boldly in the name of Jesus.


## Acts 9:28 (id: 944009028)

28And he was with them coming in and going out in Jerusalem, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord.


## Acts 9:29 (id: 944009029)

29He was both speaking and debating with the Hellenists, but they were attempting to kill him.


## Acts 9:30 (id: 944009030)

30But the brothers, having learned of this, brought him down to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus.


## Acts 9:31 (id: 944009031)

31Then the church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria was having peace; being built up and journeying in the fear of the Lord and in the encouragement of the Holy Spirit, it was multiplying.


## Acts 9:32 (id: 944009032)

32Now it happened that Peter, going throughout all, came down also to the saints inhabiting Lydda.


## Acts 9:33 (id: 944009033)

33And there he found a certain man, Aeneas by name, lying on a mat for eight years, who was paralyzed.


## Acts 9:34 (id: 944009034)

34And Peter said to him, “Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you. Arise and make your bed for yourself,” and immediately he arose.


## Acts 9:35 (id: 944009035)

35And all the ones living in Lydda and in Sharon saw him, who turned to the Lord.


## Acts 9:36 (id: 944009036)

36Now a certain disciple was in Joppa, Tabitha by name, which, being translated, is said “Dorcas.” She was full of good works and of almsgivings that she was doing.


## Acts 9:37 (id: 944009037)

37And it happened in those days that, having been sick, she died. And having washed her, they laid her in an upper room.


## Acts 9:38 (id: 944009038)

38And Lydda being near Joppa, the disciples, having heard that Peter was in it, sent two men to him, urging him, “Do not delay to come to us.”


## Acts 9:39 (id: 944009039)

39So, arising, Peter went with them, whom, having arrived, they brought up to the upper room, and all the widows stood by him, weeping and showing him coats and garments, as many as Dorcas used to make, being with them.


## Acts 9:40 (id: 944009040)

40But Peter, having put them all out and having put down {his} knees, prayed, and having turned to the body, he said, “Tabitha, arise!” Then she opened her eyes and, seeing Peter, she sat up.


## Acts 9:41 (id: 944009041)

41And giving her {his} hand, he raised her up and, calling the saints and the widows, he presented her living.


## Acts 9:42 (id: 944009042)

42And it became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed on the Lord.


## Acts 9:43 (id: 944009043)

43Now it happened that he stayed many days in Joppa with a certain Simon, a tanner.


## Acts 10:1 (id: 944010001)

1Now a certain man was in Caesarea, Cornelius by name, a centurion from the regiment called Italian,


## Acts 10:2 (id: 944010002)

2devout and fearing God with all his household, making many gifts of alms to the people and praying to God through all.


## Acts 10:3 (id: 944010003)

3About the ninth hour of the day, he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God coming to him and saying to him, “Cornelius!”


## Acts 10:4 (id: 944010004)

4But he, staring at him and having become terrified, said, “What is it, lord?” And he said to him, “Your prayers and your alms have gone up for a memorial offering before God.


## Acts 10:5 (id: 944010005)

5And now, send men to Joppa and summon a certain Simon who is called Peter.


## Acts 10:6 (id: 944010006)

6He is being hosted by a certain Simon, a tanner, to whom is a house by the sea.”


## Acts 10:7 (id: 944010007)

7And when the angel speaking to him left, calling two of {his} house servants and a devout soldier of the ones serving him,


## Acts 10:8 (id: 944010008)

8and having told them everything, he sent them to Joppa.


## Acts 10:9 (id: 944010009)

9And on the next day, as those were traveling and approaching the city, Peter went up to the housetop to pray at about the sixth hour.


## Acts 10:10 (id: 944010010)

10And he became hungry and was wanting to eat, but while they were preparing, a vision came upon him,


## Acts 10:11 (id: 944010011)

11and he sees the sky opened and a certain container, like a large sheet, descending, being let down by {its} four corners to the earth,


## Acts 10:12 (id: 944010012)

12in which were all the four\-footed animals and reptiles of the earth and birds of the sky.


## Acts 10:13 (id: 944010013)

13And a voice came to him: “Peter, arising, kill and eat.”


## Acts 10:14 (id: 944010014)

14But Peter said, “Not at all, Lord; for I have never eaten anything common and unclean.”


## Acts 10:15 (id: 944010015)

15And the voice {came} to him again, for a second {time}: “What God has cleansed, you, do not make common.”


## Acts 10:16 (id: 944010016)

16And this happened three times, and the container was immediately taken back up to the sky.


## Acts 10:17 (id: 944010017)

17And while Peter was doubting within himself what the vision that he had seen might mean, behold, the men sent by Cornelius, having found by inquiry the house of Simon, stood before the gate.


## Acts 10:18 (id: 944010018)

18And calling out, they were asking whether Simon, called Peter, was being hosted there.


## Acts 10:19 (id: 944010019)

19And while Peter was still thinking about the vision, the Spirit said to him, “Behold, three men are seeking you.


## Acts 10:20 (id: 944010020)

20But arising, go down and go with them, not hesitating, because I have sent them.”


## Acts 10:21 (id: 944010021)

21So Peter, having gone down to the men, said, “Behold, I am {he} whom you are seeking. What {is} the reason for which you are here?”


## Acts 10:22 (id: 944010022)

22And they said, “Cornelius, a centurion, a man righteous and fearing God and attested by the whole nation of the Jews, was directed by a holy angel to summon you to his house and to hear words from you.”


## Acts 10:23 (id: 944010023)

23Therefore, having invited them, he hosted them. And on the next day, arising, he went out with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa accompanied him.


## Acts 10:24 (id: 944010024)

24And on the next day they came to Caesarea. And Cornelius was awaiting them, having called together his relatives and close friends.


## Acts 10:25 (id: 944010025)

25And it happened that as Peter entered, Cornelius, meeting him {and} falling down at {his} feet, worshiped him.


## Acts 10:26 (id: 944010026)

26But Peter lifted him up, saying, “Arise! I too am a man myself.”


## Acts 10:27 (id: 944010027)

27And talking with him, he went in and finds many gathered together.


## Acts 10:28 (id: 944010028)

28And he was saying to them, “You yourselves know how unlawful it is for a Jewish man to associate or to visit with a foreigner, but God has shown me not to call any man common or unclean.


## Acts 10:29 (id: 944010029)

29And therefore, having been summoned, I came without objection. Therefore I ask you, for what reason did you summon me?”


## Acts 10:30 (id: 944010030)

30And Cornelius was saying, “Four days ago, at this hour, I was praying at the ninth {hour} in my house, and behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,


## Acts 10:31 (id: 944010031)

31and he says, ‘Cornelius, your prayer has been heard, and your alms have been remembered before God.


## Acts 10:32 (id: 944010032)

32Therefore, send to Joppa and summon Simon who is called Peter. He is being hosted in the house of Simon, a tanner, by the sea.’


## Acts 10:33 (id: 944010033)

33So immediately I sent for you, and you did well {in} coming. Now therefore, we are all here before God to hear all the things you have been instructed by the Lord {to say}.”


## Acts 10:34 (id: 944010034)

34And opening {his} mouth, Peter said, “In truth, I perceive that God is not a favoritism\-shower.


## Acts 10:35 (id: 944010035)

35Instead, in every nation the one fearing him and working righteousness is acceptable to him.


## Acts 10:36 (id: 944010036)

36The word that he sent to the sons of Israel, proclaiming peace through Jesus Christ—he is the Lord of all—


## Acts 10:37 (id: 944010037)

37you know the word having happened throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee, after the baptism that John announced;


## Acts 10:38 (id: 944010038)

38Jesus, the one from Nazareth, how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all the ones being oppressed by the devil, for God was with him.


## Acts 10:39 (id: 944010039)

39And we {are} witnesses of all that he did, both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem, whom they also killed, hanging him on a tree.


## Acts 10:40 (id: 944010040)

40God raised this one up on the third day and caused him to be seen,


## Acts 10:41 (id: 944010041)

41not by all the people, but by witnesses chosen beforehand by God—by us who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.


## Acts 10:42 (id: 944010042)

42And he commanded us to announce to the people and to testify that he is the one chosen by God as a Judge of the living and the dead.


## Acts 10:43 (id: 944010043)

43To this one all the prophets bear witness, that everyone believing in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.”


## Acts 10:44 (id: 944010044)

44While Peter was still saying these things, the Holy Spirit fell on all the ones listening to {his} word.


## Acts 10:45 (id: 944010045)

45And the faithful from the circumcision—as many as had come with Peter—marveled, because the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out also on the Gentiles.


## Acts 10:46 (id: 944010046)

46For they heard them speaking in languages and praising God. Then Peter responded,


## Acts 10:47 (id: 944010047)

47“No one is able to withhold water, is he, so that these are not baptized who have received the Holy Spirit as we also {did}?”


## Acts 10:48 (id: 944010048)

48And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay for several days.


## Acts 11:1 (id: 944011001)

1Now the apostles and the brothers being throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God.


## Acts 11:2 (id: 944011002)

2And when Peter came up to Jerusalem, those from the circumcision were disputing with him,


## Acts 11:3 (id: 944011003)

3saying that he went in to men having foreskins and ate with them.


## Acts 11:4 (id: 944011004)

4But Peter, beginning, was explaining to them in order, saying,


## Acts 11:5 (id: 944011005)

5“I was praying in the city of Joppa, and in a trance I saw a vision of a certain container coming down, like a large sheet being let down from the sky by {its} four corners, and it came unto me,


## Acts 11:6 (id: 944011006)

6gazing into which I was looking closely and I saw the four\-legged animals of the earth, and the wild beasts, and the creeping animals, and the birds of the sky.


## Acts 11:7 (id: 944011007)

7Then I also heard a voice saying to me, ‘Peter, arising, kill and eat!’


## Acts 11:8 (id: 944011008)

8But I said, ‘By no means, Lord; for the common or unclean has never entered into my mouth.’


## Acts 11:9 (id: 944011009)

9But the voice answered for a second {time} from heaven, ‘What God has cleansed, you, do not make common!’


## Acts 11:10 (id: 944011010)

10And this happened three times, and everything was pulled up to the sky again.


## Acts 11:11 (id: 944011011)

11And behold, immediately three men stood at the house in which we were, having been sent from Caesarea to me.


## Acts 11:12 (id: 944011012)

12And the Spirit said to me to go with them, not hesitating. And these six brothers also went with me, and we entered into the house of the man.


## Acts 11:13 (id: 944011013)

13Then he reported to us how he had seen the angel standing in his house and saying, ‘Send to Joppa and summon Simon, called Peter.


## Acts 11:14 (id: 944011014)

14He will speak words to you by which you will be saved—you and all your house.’


## Acts 11:15 (id: 944011015)

15But as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, just as also on us in the beginning.


## Acts 11:16 (id: 944011016)

16Then I remembered the word of the Lord, how he was saying, ‘John indeed baptized with water; but you will be baptized in the Holy Spirit.’


## Acts 11:17 (id: 944011017)

17If, therefore, God gave to them the same gift as also to us having believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, I, who was I {to be} able to hinder God?”


## Acts 11:18 (id: 944011018)

18And having heard these things, they became quiet and glorified God, saying, “Then to the Gentiles also God has given repentance unto life.”


## Acts 11:19 (id: 944011019)

19Then indeed the ones having been scattered from the persecution having happened over Stephen spread to Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except only to Jews.


## Acts 11:20 (id: 944011020)

20But some of them were men, Cypriots and Cyrenians, who, having come to Antioch, were speaking also to the Greeks, proclaiming the Lord Jesus.


## Acts 11:21 (id: 944011021)

21And the hand of the Lord was with them; and a great number, believing, turned to the Lord.


## Acts 11:22 (id: 944011022)

22And the report about them came to the ears of the church that was in Jerusalem, and they sent out Barnabas as far as Antioch,


## Acts 11:23 (id: 944011023)

23who, having come and having seen the grace of God, rejoiced and was encouraging {them} all to remain with the Lord with purpose of heart.


## Acts 11:24 (id: 944011024)

24For he was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith, and a considerable crowd was added to the Lord.


## Acts 11:25 (id: 944011025)

25And he went out to Tarsus to search for Saul.


## Acts 11:26 (id: 944011026)

26And having found him, he brought him to Antioch. And it happened to them that for even a whole year they were gathered together with the church and taught a considerable crowd. And the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.


## Acts 11:27 (id: 944011027)

27Now in these days prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.


## Acts 11:28 (id: 944011028)

28And one of them, Agabus by name, having arisen, signified through the Spirit {that} a great famine was about to occur over the whole world. This happened upon Claudius.


## Acts 11:29 (id: 944011029)

29So they determined, just as any of the disciples was prospering, each of them to send {something} for assistance to the brothers living in Judea,


## Acts 11:30 (id: 944011030)

30which indeed they did, sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.


## Acts 12:1 (id: 944012001)

1Now at that time Herod the king laid on hands to harm some from the church.


## Acts 12:2 (id: 944012002)

2And he killed James, the brother of John, with the sword.


## Acts 12:3 (id: 944012003)

3And seeing that this was pleasing to the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also (and those were the days of Unleavened Bread),


## Acts 12:4 (id: 944012004)

4and whom, having arrested, he put in prison, handing him over to four quaternions of soldiers to guard him, intending to bring him out to the people after the Passover.


## Acts 12:5 (id: 944012005)

5So indeed Peter was being kept in the prison, but prayer was being made earnestly to God for him by the church.


## Acts 12:6 (id: 944012006)

6And when Herod was going to bring him out, that night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and guards before the door were watching the prison.


## Acts 12:7 (id: 944012007)

7And behold, an angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light shone in the prison cell. And striking the side of Peter, he awakened him, saying, “Get up in haste,” and his chains fell away from {his} hands.


## Acts 12:8 (id: 944012008)

8And the angel said to him, “Gird yourself and tie on your sandals.” So he did thus. And he said to him, “Put on your outer garment and follow me.”


## Acts 12:9 (id: 944012009)

9And going out, he followed him, but he did not know that what was being done by the angel was real, but he was thinking he was seeing a vision.


## Acts 12:10 (id: 944012010)

10But having passed by the first guard and the second, they came to the iron gate leading into the city, which opened for them by itself. And having gone out, they went down one street, and suddenly the angel went away from him.


## Acts 12:11 (id: 944012011)

11And Peter, having come to himself, said, “Now I truly know that the Lord sent out his angel and delivered me from the hand of Herod and all the expectation of the Jewish people.”


## Acts 12:12 (id: 944012012)

12And having realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John, called Mark, where many were gathered together and praying.


## Acts 12:13 (id: 944012013)

13And when he knocked at the door of the gate, a servant girl, Rhoda by name, came to answer.


## Acts 12:14 (id: 944012014)

14And having recognized the voice of Peter, from joy she did not open the gate, but running inside, she reported, “Peter is standing at the gate!”


## Acts 12:15 (id: 944012015)

15But they said to her, “You are insane!” But she was insisting that it was thus. So they were saying, “It is his angel.”


## Acts 12:16 (id: 944012016)

16But Peter was continuing knocking, and opening, they saw him and marveled.


## Acts 12:17 (id: 944012017)

17And having motioned to them with {his} hand to be silent, he described how the Lord had led him out from the prison. And he said, “Report these things to James and the brothers.” And having gone out, he went to another place.


## Acts 12:18 (id: 944012018)

18Now when day had come, there was no small disturbance among the soldiers, what then had Peter become.


## Acts 12:19 (id: 944012019)

19And Herod, having searched for him and not having found him, having questioned the guards, ordered them to be put to death. And having gone down from Judea to Caesarea, he was staying there.


## Acts 12:20 (id: 944012020)

20Now he was quarreling with the Tyrians and Sidonians. So they came to him unanimously, and having persuaded Blastus, the one over the bedchamber of the king, they were requesting peace, because their country was nourished from the king’s country.


## Acts 12:21 (id: 944012021)

21And on the appointed day, Herod, having put on royal clothing and having sat on the throne, made a speech to them.


## Acts 12:22 (id: 944012022)

22And the people were shouting, “The voice of a god and not of a man!”


## Acts 12:23 (id: 944012023)

23And immediately an angel of the Lord struck him because he did not give the glory to God, and having become worm\-eaten, he died.


## Acts 12:24 (id: 944012024)

24But the word of God was increasing and was being multiplied.


## Acts 12:25 (id: 944012025)

25Then Barnabas and Saul returned to Jerusalem, having completed their service, bringing with them John, called Mark.


## Acts 13:1 (id: 944013001)

1Now in Antioch, in the church being {there}, were prophets and teachers: both Barnabas and Simeon called Niger, and Lucius the Cyrenian; both Manaen, the foster brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.


## Acts 13:2 (id: 944013002)

2And while they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, “Separate, then, Barnabas and Saul to me for the work to which I have called them.”


## Acts 13:3 (id: 944013003)

3Then, having fasted and prayed, and having laid {their} hands on them, they released them.


## Acts 13:4 (id: 944013004)

4So they, having been sent out by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia; and from there they sailed away to Cyprus.


## Acts 13:5 (id: 944013005)

5And having arrived in Salamis, they were proclaiming the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. And they also had John as an assistant.


## Acts 13:6 (id: 944013006)

6And having passed through the whole island as far as Paphos, they found a certain man, a magician, a Jewish false prophet, whose name {was} Bar Jesus,


## Acts 13:7 (id: 944013007)

7who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus—an intelligent man. Summoning Barnabas and Saul, he sought to hear the word of God.


## Acts 13:8 (id: 944013008)

8But Elymas, “the Magician” (for thus is his name translated), opposed them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith.


## Acts 13:9 (id: 944013009)

9But Saul, also Paul, being filled with the Holy Spirit, staring at him intently,


## Acts 13:10 (id: 944013010)

10said, “O full of all deceit and all trickery, son of the devil, enemy of all righteousness, will you not stop turning aside the straight paths of the Lord?


## Acts 13:11 (id: 944013011)

11And now, behold, the hand of the Lord {is} upon you, and you will be blind, not seeing the sun for a time.” And immediately a mist and darkness fell upon him, and going around, he was seeking someone to lead him by the hand.


## Acts 13:12 (id: 944013012)

12Then the proconsul, having seen the {thing} having happened, believed, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord.


## Acts 13:13 (id: 944013013)

13Now having put to sea from Paphos, the ones around Paul came to Perga of Pamphylia. But John, withdrawing from them, returned to Jerusalem.


## Acts 13:14 (id: 944013014)

14But they, passing through from Perga, came to Antioch of Pisidia and, going into the synagogue on the day of the Sabbath, they sat down.


## Acts 13:15 (id: 944013015)

15And after the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the synagogue leaders sent to them, saying, “Men, brothers, if any word of exhortation for the people is in you, speak.”


## Acts 13:16 (id: 944013016)

16So Paul, arising and motioning with {his} hand, said, “Men, Israelites and ones fearing God, listen.


## Acts 13:17 (id: 944013017)

17The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and exalted the people when they sojourned in the land of Egypt, and with an uplifted arm he led them out of it.


## Acts 13:18 (id: 944013018)

18And for about a 40\-year time, he endured them in the wilderness.


## Acts 13:19 (id: 944013019)

19And having destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land for an inheritance,


## Acts 13:20 (id: 944013020)

20in about 450 years. And after these things, he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet.


## Acts 13:21 (id: 944013021)

21And then they requested a king, and God gave them Saul, son of Kish, a man from the tribe of Benjamin, for 40 years.


## Acts 13:22 (id: 944013022)

22And having removed him, he raised up David for them for {their} king, about whom also he said, testifying, ‘I have found David, {son} of Jesse, a man according to my heart, who will do all my will.’


## Acts 13:23 (id: 944013023)

23From the seed of this one, according to promise, God brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus,


## Acts 13:24 (id: 944013024)

24John having announced beforehand, before the face of his entrance, a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.


## Acts 13:25 (id: 944013025)

25And as John was completing {his} course, he was saying, ‘Who do you think me to be? I am not he. But behold, one is coming after me, of whom the sandals of {his} feet I am not worthy to untie.’


## Acts 13:26 (id: 944013026)

26Men, brothers, sons of the family of Abraham, and the ones among you fearing God, to us the word of this salvation has been sent.


## Acts 13:27 (id: 944013027)

27For the ones living in Jerusalem and their rulers, not recognizing this one and condemning him, fulfilled the voices of the prophets being read on every Sabbath.


## Acts 13:28 (id: 944013028)

28And finding no reason for death, they asked Pilate for him to be killed.


## Acts 13:29 (id: 944013029)

29And when they had completed all the things having been written about him, taking him down from the tree, they laid him in a tomb.


## Acts 13:30 (id: 944013030)

30But God raised him from the dead,


## Acts 13:31 (id: 944013031)

31who was seen for many days by the ones having come up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who now are his witnesses to the people.


## Acts 13:32 (id: 944013032)

32And we are proclaiming to you the promise having been to {our} fathers,


## Acts 13:33 (id: 944013033)

33that God has completely fulfilled this for our children, raising up Jesus. As it is also written in the second Psalm: ‘You are my Son; today I have fathered you.’


## Acts 13:34 (id: 944013034)

34And that he raised him up from the dead, never going to return to decay, he has spoken thus: ‘I will give you the holy, trustworthy things of David.’


## Acts 13:35 (id: 944013035)

35For in another {place} he also says: ‘You will not allow your Holy One to see decay.’


## Acts 13:36 (id: 944013036)

36For indeed David, having served the counsel of God in his own generation, fell asleep and was laid with his fathers and saw decay.


## Acts 13:37 (id: 944013037)

37But he whom God raised up did not see decay.


## Acts 13:38 (id: 944013038)

38So let it be known to you, men, brothers, that through this one release of sins is proclaimed to you and from everything of which you were not able to be justified in the law of Moses.


## Acts 13:39 (id: 944013039)

39In this one, everyone believing is justified.


## Acts 13:40 (id: 944013040)

40Look, therefore that the thing spoken about in the prophets may not come upon you:


## Acts 13:41 (id: 944013041)

41‘Look, you despisers, and marvel and be destroyed! For I am doing a work in your days, a work that you would not believe at all, even if someone announced it to you.’”


## Acts 13:42 (id: 944013042)

42And as they were leaving, they were begging these words to be spoken to them on the next Sabbath.


## Acts 13:43 (id: 944013043)

43And when the synagogue meeting was ended, many of the Jews and the worshiping proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who, speaking to them, urged them to continue in the grace of God.


## Acts 13:44 (id: 944013044)

44And on the next Sabbath, almost the whole city was gathered together to hear the word of the Lord.


## Acts 13:45 (id: 944013045)

45But seeing the crowds, the Jews were filled with jealousy, and they were speaking against the things being said by Paul, blaspheming.


## Acts 13:46 (id: 944013046)

46And Paul and Barnabas, speaking boldly, said, “It was necessary for the word of God to be spoken to you first. Since you reject it and judge yourselves not worthy of eternal life, behold, we are turning to the Gentiles.


## Acts 13:47 (id: 944013047)

47For thus the Lord has commanded us: ‘I have placed you as a light for the Gentiles, for you to be for salvation as far as the end of the earth.’”


## Acts 13:48 (id: 944013048)

48But hearing this, the Gentiles were rejoicing and glorifying the word of the Lord, and as many as were appointed to eternal life believed.


## Acts 13:49 (id: 944013049)

49And the word of the Lord was being spread throughout the whole region.


## Acts 13:50 (id: 944013050)

50But the Jews stirred up the influential worshiping women and the principal ones of the city and aroused a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and they threw them out from their boundaries.


## Acts 13:51 (id: 944013051)

51But they, having shaken off the dust of {their} feet against them, went to Iconium.


## Acts 13:52 (id: 944013052)

52But the disciples were filled with joy and the Holy Spirit.


## Acts 14:1 (id: 944014001)

1And it happened that in Iconium they entered together into the synagogue of the Jews and spoke in such a way that a great multitude, both of Jews and of Greeks, believed.


## Acts 14:2 (id: 944014002)

2But the disobeying Jews stirred up and embittered the souls of the Gentiles against the brothers.


## Acts 14:3 (id: 944014003)

3But indeed they stayed there for a long time, speaking boldly for the Lord, who was testifying to the word of his grace by granting signs and wonders to happen by their hands.


## Acts 14:4 (id: 944014004)

4But the multitude of the city was divided, and some indeed were with the Jews, but some with the apostles.


## Acts 14:5 (id: 944014005)

5But when a plot happened of both the Gentiles and the Jews, with their rulers, to mistreat and stone them,


## Acts 14:6 (id: 944014006)

6having become aware of it, they fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the surrounding region,


## Acts 14:7 (id: 944014007)

7and there they were proclaiming the gospel.


## Acts 14:8 (id: 944014008)

8And in Lystra a certain man was sitting, powerless in {his} feet, lame from the womb of his mother, who had never walked.


## Acts 14:9 (id: 944014009)

9He heard Paul speaking, who looked intently at him and saw that he had faith to be healed.


## Acts 14:10 (id: 944014010)

10He said in a loud voice, “Stand upright on your feet,” and he jumped up and walked around.


## Acts 14:11 (id: 944014011)

11And the crowds, seeing what Paul had done, raised their voice, saying in Lycaonian, “The gods, having been made like men, have come down to us.”


## Acts 14:12 (id: 944014012)

12And they were calling Barnabas “Zeus,” and Paul “Hermes,” because he was the leader of the word.


## Acts 14:13 (id: 944014013)

13And the priest of Zeus, being before the city, bringing oxen and wreaths to the gates, was wanting to sacrifice with the crowds.


## Acts 14:14 (id: 944014014)

14But hearing this, the apostles Barnabas and Paul, tearing their clothing, rushed out into the crowd, crying out


## Acts 14:15 (id: 944014015)

15and saying, “Men, why are you doing these things? We also are men, like\-passioned to you. We are proclaiming the gospel to you to turn you from these useless things to the living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and everything in them,


## Acts 14:16 (id: 944014016)

16who in bygone generations allowed all the nations to go their own ways,


## Acts 14:17 (id: 944014017)

17and yet he did not leave himself without witness: doing good, giving you rains from the sky and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness.”


## Acts 14:18 (id: 944014018)

18And saying these things they barely restrained the crowds, so that they did not sacrifice to them.


## Acts 14:19 (id: 944014019)

19But Jews from Antioch and Iconium came and, having persuaded the crowds and having stoned Paul, they were dragging him out of the city, thinking him to have died.


## Acts 14:20 (id: 944014020)

20But as the disciples surrounded him, arising, he entered into the city, and the next day he went with Barnabas to Derbe.


## Acts 14:21 (id: 944014021)

21And having proclaimed the gospel in that city and having made many disciples, they returned to Lystra and to Iconium and Antioch,


## Acts 14:22 (id: 944014022)

22strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to continue in the faith, and {saying}, “It is necessary for us to enter into the kingdom of God through many afflictions.”


## Acts 14:23 (id: 944014023)

23And having appointed elders for them by church, having prayed with fasting, they entrusted them to the Lord in whom they had believed.


## Acts 14:24 (id: 944014024)

24And having passed through Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.


## Acts 14:25 (id: 944014025)

25And having spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.


## Acts 14:26 (id: 944014026)

26And from there they sailed to Antioch, where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work which they had completed.


## Acts 14:27 (id: 944014027)

27And having arrived and having gathered the church together, they were reporting how much God had done with them and that he had opened a door of faith for the Gentiles.


## Acts 14:28 (id: 944014028)

28And they were staying for not a little time with the disciples.


## Acts 15:1 (id: 944015001)

1And certain ones coming down from Judea were teaching the brothers, “Unless you are circumcised in the custom of Moses, you are not able to be saved.”


## Acts 15:2 (id: 944015002)

2And no little dispute and debate by Paul and Barnabas with them having happened, they appointed Paul and Barnabas and certain others from among them to go up to the apostles and elders in Jerusalem about this question.


## Acts 15:3 (id: 944015003)

3Therefore indeed the ones having been sent out by the church were passing through both Phoenicia and Samaria, describing the conversion of the Gentiles and producing great joy in all the brothers,


## Acts 15:4 (id: 944015004)

4And having arrived in Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and the elders, and they reported how much God had done with them.


## Acts 15:5 (id: 944015005)

5But certain ones from the sect of the Pharisees, having believed, stood up, saying, “It is necessary to circumcise them and command them to keep the law of Moses.”


## Acts 15:6 (id: 944015006)

6So the apostles and the elders were gathered together to see about this word.


## Acts 15:7 (id: 944015007)

7And much debate having happened, Peter, arising, said to them, “Men, brothers, you know that from original days God chose among you: By my mouth the Gentiles would hear the word of the gospel and believe.


## Acts 15:8 (id: 944015008)

8And God, the heart\-knower, testified to them, giving them the Holy Spirit, just as also to us;


## Acts 15:9 (id: 944015009)

9and he did not distinguish between us and them, having cleansed their hearts by faith.


## Acts 15:10 (id: 944015010)

10Now, therefore, why are you testing God, putting a yoke upon the neck of the disciples that neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear?


## Acts 15:11 (id: 944015011)

11But we believe ourselves to be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, according to the way they also.”


## Acts 15:12 (id: 944015012)

12And the whole crowd kept silent and was listening to Barnabas and Paul describing how many signs and wonders God had worked among the Gentiles through them.


## Acts 15:13 (id: 944015013)

13And after they stopped speaking, James answered, saying, “Men, brothers, listen to me.


## Acts 15:14 (id: 944015014)

14Simeon has described how God first looked to take from the Gentiles a people for his name.


## Acts 15:15 (id: 944015015)

15And with this the words of the prophets agree, as it is written,


## Acts 15:16 (id: 944015016)

16‘After these things I will return, and I will rebuild the fallen tent of David, and I will rebuild its ruins and restore it,


## Acts 15:17 (id: 944015017)

17so that the remnant of men may seek the Lord, even all the Gentiles upon whom my name has been called upon them, says the Lord doing these things


## Acts 15:18 (id: 944015018)

18known from eternity.’


## Acts 15:19 (id: 944015019)

19Therefore, I judge not to trouble the ones from the Gentiles turning to God,


## Acts 15:20 (id: 944015020)

20but to write to them to abstain from the pollution of idols and sexual immorality and the strangled and blood.


## Acts 15:21 (id: 944015021)

21For Moses has by city, from ancient generations, ones proclaiming him, being read in the synagogues on every Sabbath.”


## Acts 15:22 (id: 944015022)

22Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to send to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas chosen men from among them—Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, leading men among the brothers—


## Acts 15:23 (id: 944015023)

23writing by their hand: “The apostles and the elders, brothers, to the brothers among the Gentiles throughout Antioch and Syria and Cilicia: Greetings!


## Acts 15:24 (id: 944015024)

24Now we have heard that some, having gone out from us, have disturbed you with words, upsetting your souls, whom we did not commission;


## Acts 15:25 (id: 944015025)

25it seemed good to us, having become unanimous, having chosen men, to send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,


## Acts 15:26 (id: 944015026)

26men having handed over their souls for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.


## Acts 15:27 (id: 944015027)

27Therefore we have sent Judas and Silas, they also reporting the same thing by word.


## Acts 15:28 (id: 944015028)

28For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us for no greater burden to be laid upon you than these necessary things:


## Acts 15:29 (id: 944015029)

29to abstain from things sacrificed to idols and blood and the strangled and sexual immorality, from which keeping yourselves, you will do well. Farewell.”


## Acts 15:30 (id: 944015030)

30So they, having been dismissed, indeed came down to Antioch, and gathering the crowd together, they delivered the letter.


## Acts 15:31 (id: 944015031)

31And having read it, they rejoiced at the encouragement.


## Acts 15:32 (id: 944015032)

32Both Judas and Silas, also being prophets themselves, encouraged the brothers with many a word and strengthened them.


## Acts 15:33 (id: 944015033)

33And having stayed some time, they were sent away with peace from the brothers to the ones having sent them.


## Acts 15:34 (id: 944015034)

34\[But it seemed good to Silas for them to remain there, so only Judas traveled.]


## Acts 15:35 (id: 944015035)

35But Paul and Barnabas were staying in Antioch, teaching and proclaiming the word of the Lord, with many others also.


## Acts 15:36 (id: 944015036)

36Then after some days, Paul said to Barnabas, “Returning, then, let us visit the brothers in every city in which we proclaimed the word of the Lord, how they are.”


## Acts 15:37 (id: 944015037)

37But Barnabas was wanting also to take with them John called Mark.


## Acts 15:38 (id: 944015038)

38But Paul was thinking it wise not to take with them this one having withdrawn from them in Pamphylia and not having accompanied them in the work.


## Acts 15:39 (id: 944015039)

39And a dispute happened, so as for them to be separated from each other and for Barnabas, taking Mark with him, to sail away to Cyprus.


## Acts 15:40 (id: 944015040)

40But Paul, having chosen Silas, went out, having been commended by the brothers to the grace of the Lord.


## Acts 15:41 (id: 944015041)

41And he was going through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.


## Acts 16:1 (id: 944016001)

1And he also came down to Derbe and to Lystra, and behold, a certain disciple was there, Timothy by name, the son of a believing Jewish woman but of a father, a Greek,


## Acts 16:2 (id: 944016002)

2who was being well attested by the brothers in Lystra and Iconium.


## Acts 16:3 (id: 944016003)

3Paul wanted this one to go out with him and, taking him, he circumcised him because of the Jews being in those places, for they all knew that his father was a Greek.


## Acts 16:4 (id: 944016004)

4And as they were going through the cities, they were delivering to them to keep the decrees that had been decided by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem.


## Acts 16:5 (id: 944016005)

5So indeed the churches were being strengthened in the faith and were increasing in number each day.


## Acts 16:6 (id: 944016006)

6And they went through Phrygia and the Galatian region, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia.


## Acts 16:7 (id: 944016007)

7And having come near Mysia, they were attempting to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not permit them.


## Acts 16:8 (id: 944016008)

8So passing by Mysia, they came down to Troas.


## Acts 16:9 (id: 944016009)

9And a vision appeared to Paul by night: A man, a certain Macedonian, was standing and calling him and saying, “Coming over into Macedonia, help us.”


## Acts 16:10 (id: 944016010)

10So when he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go out into Macedonia, reasoning together that God had summoned us to proclaim the gospel to them.


## Acts 16:11 (id: 944016011)

11So setting sail from Troas, we made a straight course to Samothrace, and the next day to Neapolis,


## Acts 16:12 (id: 944016012)

12and from there to Philippi, which is the first city in the district of Macedonia, a colony, and we were staying in this city for some days.


## Acts 16:13 (id: 944016013)

13And on the day of the Sabbath, we went outside the gate by a river, where we thought a place of prayer to be. And having sat down, we spoke to the women having come together.


## Acts 16:14 (id: 944016014)

14And a certain woman, Lydia by name, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, worshiping God, was listening, whose heart the Lord opened to pay attention to the things being said by Paul.


## Acts 16:15 (id: 944016015)

15And when she was baptized, and her household, she urged us, saying, “If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, entering into my house, stay.” And she persuaded us.


## Acts 16:16 (id: 944016016)

16And it happened that as we were going to the place of prayer, a certain young female slave having a Python spirit met us, who, divining, was bringing much gain to her masters.


## Acts 16:17 (id: 944016017)

17She, following after Paul and us, was shouting, saying, “These men are servants of the Most High God who are proclaiming to you the way of salvation.”


## Acts 16:18 (id: 944016018)

18And she was doing this for many days. But Paul, having become annoyed and having turned, said to the spirit, “I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out from her.” And it came out in the same hour.


## Acts 16:19 (id: 944016019)

19But her masters, seeing that their hope of profit had gone, seizing Paul and Silas, dragged them into the marketplace to the rulers.


## Acts 16:20 (id: 944016020)

20And having brought them to the magistrates, they said, “These men are greatly troubling our city, being Jews,


## Acts 16:21 (id: 944016021)

21and they are proclaiming customs that are lawful for us neither to accept nor to practice, being Romans.”


## Acts 16:22 (id: 944016022)

22And the crowd rose up together against them, and the magistrates, tearing off their garments, commanded them to be beaten with rods.


## Acts 16:23 (id: 944016023)

23And having laid many blows upon them, they threw them into prison, commanding the jailer to guard them securely,


## Acts 16:24 (id: 944016024)

24who, having received such a command, threw them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks.


## Acts 16:25 (id: 944016025)

25But around midnight, Paul and Silas, praying, were singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them.


## Acts 16:26 (id: 944016026)

26And suddenly a great earthquake happened, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken, and immediately all the doors were opened, and the chains of all were unfastened.


## Acts 16:27 (id: 944016027)

27But the jailer became awake, and seeing the prison doors having been opened, having drawn {his} sword, he was about to kill himself, thinking the prisoners to have escaped.


## Acts 16:28 (id: 944016028)

28But Paul shouted with a loud voice, saying, “Do not do harm to yourself, for we are all here.”


## Acts 16:29 (id: 944016029)

29So having called for lights, he rushed in and, being terrified, he fell down to Paul and Silas,


## Acts 16:30 (id: 944016030)

30and having brought them out, he said, “Sirs, what is necessary for me to do in order to be saved?”


## Acts 16:31 (id: 944016031)

31And they said, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.”


## Acts 16:32 (id: 944016032)

32And they spoke the word of the Lord to him, with everyone in his house.


## Acts 16:33 (id: 944016033)

33And taking them at that hour of the night, he washed them from the blows, and he was baptized immediately—he and all the ones of him.


## Acts 16:34 (id: 944016034)

34And bringing them up into {his} house, he set a table before them and rejoiced with {his} household, having believed in God.


## Acts 16:35 (id: 944016035)

35Now when day came, the magistrates sent officers, saying, “Release those men.”


## Acts 16:36 (id: 944016036)

36And the jailer reported the words to Paul, “The magistrates have sent that you may be released. Now therefore, coming out, go in peace.”


## Acts 16:37 (id: 944016037)

37But Paul said to them, “Having beaten us in public without trial, men being Romans, they threw us into prison, and now they cast us out secretly? For not! Instead, coming themselves, let them lead us out.”


## Acts 16:38 (id: 944016038)

38So the officers reported these words to the magistrates and they were terrified, hearing that they were Romans.


## Acts 16:39 (id: 944016039)

39And coming, they entreated them, and bringing them out, they were asking them to go away from the city.


## Acts 16:40 (id: 944016040)

40So going out from the prison, they came to Lydia. And seeing the brothers, they exhorted them and went out.


## Acts 17:1 (id: 944017001)

1Now passing through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where a synagogue of the Jews was.


## Acts 17:2 (id: 944017002)

2And according to the custom of Paul, he went to them, and on three Sabbaths he was reasoning with them from the Scriptures,


## Acts 17:3 (id: 944017003)

3fully opening them and demonstrating that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead, and {saying}, “This Jesus, whom I proclaim to you, is the Christ.”


## Acts 17:4 (id: 944017004)

4And some from them were persuaded and were associated with Paul and Silas, both a large number of worshiping Greeks and not a few of the leading women.


## Acts 17:5 (id: 944017005)

5But the Jews, having become jealous, and having brought certain wicked men from the marketplace, and having gathered a crowd, they agitated the city. And attacking the house of Jason, they sought to lead them out to the people.


## Acts 17:6 (id: 944017006)

6But not having found them, they dragged Jason and certain brothers to the city officials, shouting, “The ones having turned the world upside down, they are also present here,


## Acts 17:7 (id: 944017007)

7whom Jason and all these men have welcomed. They are acting against the decrees of Caesar, saying there is another king, Jesus.”


## Acts 17:8 (id: 944017008)

8And they agitated the crowd and the city officials hearing these things.


## Acts 17:9 (id: 944017009)

9And having received a bond from Jason and the rest, they released them.


## Acts 17:10 (id: 944017010)

10But the brothers immediately sent away both Paul and Silas by night to Berea, who, having arrived, went into the synagogue of the Jews.


## Acts 17:11 (id: 944017011)

11Now these were more noble than {those} in Thessalonica, who received the word with all readiness, examining the Scriptures each day, whether these things might be so.


## Acts 17:12 (id: 944017012)

12Then indeed many of them believed, even influential Greek women and not a few men.


## Acts 17:13 (id: 944017013)

13But when the Jews from Thessalonica learned that the word of God was also being proclaimed by Paul at Berea, they came there also, exciting and troubling the crowds.


## Acts 17:14 (id: 944017014)

14So then the brothers immediately sent Paul away to go as far as to the sea, but both Silas and Timothy stayed there.


## Acts 17:15 (id: 944017015)

15But the ones conducting Paul brought him as far as Athens and, having received a command to Silas and Timothy that they should come to him as quickly as possible, they departed.


## Acts 17:16 (id: 944017016)

16Now while Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was being provoked within him, seeing the city being full of idols.


## Acts 17:17 (id: 944017017)

17So indeed he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the ones worshiping and in the marketplace every day with the ones meeting him.


## Acts 17:18 (id: 944017018)

18But also some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers were disputing with him. And some were saying, “What might this word\-picker want to say?” But others {said}, “He seems to be a proclaimer of foreign gods,” because he was proclaiming Jesus and the resurrection.


## Acts 17:19 (id: 944017019)

19And taking hold of him, they brought him to the Areopagus, saying, “Are we able to know what this new teaching {is} that is being spoken by you?


## Acts 17:20 (id: 944017020)

20For you are bringing some startling things into our ears. Therefore, we wish to know what these things want to be.”


## Acts 17:21 (id: 944017021)

21(Now all the Athenians and the sojourning foreigners were devoting their leisure to nothing other than either to say something or to hear something newer.)


## Acts 17:22 (id: 944017022)

22And Paul, having been stood in the middle of the Areopagus, was saying, “Men, Athenians, I see how you are more religious in everything.


## Acts 17:23 (id: 944017023)

23For passing through and observing your objects of worship, I even found an altar on which had been inscribed, ‘To an Unknown God.’ What therefore you worship not knowing, this I announce to you.


## Acts 17:24 (id: 944017024)

24The God having made the world and everything in it, he, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in hand\-built temples.


## Acts 17:25 (id: 944017025)

25Neither is he cared for by hands of men, needing anything, himself giving life and breath and all things to all.


## Acts 17:26 (id: 944017026)

26And from one he made every nation of men to live on all the face of the earth, having determined {their} appointed seasons and the boundaries of their habitation,


## Acts 17:27 (id: 944017027)

27to seek God, if perhaps they might feel around for him and find him, yet indeed not being far from each one of us.


## Acts 17:28 (id: 944017028)

28For ‘in him we live and are moved and are,’ and as some of your own poets have said, ‘For we too are {his} offspring.’


## Acts 17:29 (id: 944017029)

29Therefore, being offspring of God, we ought not to consider the Divine to be similar to gold or silver or stone—images of the skill and imagination of man.


## Acts 17:30 (id: 944017030)

30Therefore God, having indeed overlooked the times of ignorance, now to men commands everyone everywhere to repent,


## Acts 17:31 (id: 944017031)

31because he has set a day in which he is going to judge the world in righteousness by the man whom he has appointed, having provided assurance to all, having raised him from the dead.”


## Acts 17:32 (id: 944017032)

32Now hearing of the resurrection of the dead, some indeed mocked, but others said, “We will hear you also again concerning this.”


## Acts 17:33 (id: 944017033)

33So Paul went out from their midst.


## Acts 17:34 (id: 944017034)

34But certain men, being joined to him, believed, among whom {were} even Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman, Damaris by name, and others with them.


## Acts 18:1 (id: 944018001)

1After these things, having departed from Athens, he went to Corinth.


## Acts 18:2 (id: 944018002)

2And having found a certain Jew, Aquila by name, a Pontian by birth, having recently come from Italy, also Priscilla, his wife, because Claudius had ordered all the Jews to depart from Rome, he approached them,


## Acts 18:3 (id: 944018003)

3and because he was of the same trade, he stayed with them and was working, for they were tentmakers by trade.


## Acts 18:4 (id: 944018004)

4And he was reasoning in the synagogue on every Sabbath, persuading both Jews and Greeks.


## Acts 18:5 (id: 944018005)

5But when both Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was constrained by the word, to the Jews solemnly attesting Jesus to be the Christ.


## Acts 18:6 (id: 944018006)

6But as they were opposing and insulting him, shaking out {his} garments, he said to them, “Your blood {be} upon your head! I am clean! From now on I will go to the Gentiles.”


## Acts 18:7 (id: 944018007)

7And having departed from there, he went into the house of a certain one worshiping God, Titius Justus by name, whose house was adjoining to the synagogue.


## Acts 18:8 (id: 944018008)

8But Crispus, the synagogue leader, believed in the Lord with his whole house, and many of the Corinthians, hearing, were believing and were being baptized.


## Acts 18:9 (id: 944018009)

9And the Lord said to Paul by a vision in the night, “Do not fear, but speak and do not be silent.


## Acts 18:10 (id: 944018010)

10For I am with you, and no one will set upon you to harm you, for much people is to me in this city.”


## Acts 18:11 (id: 944018011)

11So he stayed for a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.


## Acts 18:12 (id: 944018012)

12But when Gallio was governor of Achaia, the Jews rose up unanimously against Paul and brought him to the judgment seat,


## Acts 18:13 (id: 944018013)

13saying, “This one persuades men to worship God contrary to the law.”


## Acts 18:14 (id: 944018014)

14But when Paul was going to open {his} mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, “O Jews, if indeed it was some crime or evil wrongdoing, by reason I would have endured you,


## Acts 18:15 (id: 944018015)

15but if the questions {are} about word and names and your law, you will see yourselves. I do not want to be a judge of these things.”


## Acts 18:16 (id: 944018016)

16And he sent them away from the judgment seat.


## Acts 18:17 (id: 944018017)

17But having seized Sosthenes, the synagogue leader, they were all beating him before the judgment seat, and none of these things mattered to Gallio.


## Acts 18:18 (id: 944018018)

18But Paul, having stayed yet many days, leaving the brothers, sailed to Syria, Priscilla and Aquila also {being} with him, having shorn {his} head in Cenchrea, for he had a vow.


## Acts 18:19 (id: 944018019)

19And they came down to Ephesus and them he left there, but he himself, having gone into the synagogue, reasoned with the Jews.


## Acts 18:20 (id: 944018020)

20But when they asked him to stay for a longer time, he did not consent.


## Acts 18:21 (id: 944018021)

21But leaving them and saying, “I will return again to you, God being willing,” he put to sea from Ephesus.


## Acts 18:22 (id: 944018022)

22And having come down to Caesarea, having gone up and having greeted the church, he went down to Antioch.


## Acts 18:23 (id: 944018023)

23And having stayed some time, he departed, going through the region of Galatia and Phrygia in succession, strengthening all the disciples.


## Acts 18:24 (id: 944018024)

24Now a certain Jewish man, Apollos by name, an Alexandrian by birth, an eloquent man, came down to Ephesus, being mighty in the Scriptures.


## Acts 18:25 (id: 944018025)

25He had been taught the way of the Lord, and being fervent in spirit, he was speaking and teaching accurately the things concerning Jesus, knowing only the baptism of John.


## Acts 18:26 (id: 944018026)

26And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue, but hearing him, Priscilla and Aquila took him aside and explained to him the way of God more accurately.


## Acts 18:27 (id: 944018027)

27And when he desired to pass over into Achaia, the brothers, encouraging him, wrote to the disciples to welcome him, who, having arrived, greatly helped the ones having believed by grace.


## Acts 18:28 (id: 944018028)

28For he was powerfully refuting the Jews in public, showing Jesus to be the Christ by the Scriptures.


## Acts 19:1 (id: 944019001)

1And it happened that while Apollos was in Corinth, Paul, passing through the upper parts, came down to Ephesus and found certain disciples.


## Acts 19:2 (id: 944019002)

2And he said to them, “If you received the Holy Spirit, having believed?” But they said to him, “No, we have not even heard if there is a Holy Spirit.”


## Acts 19:3 (id: 944019003)

3And he said, “Into what then were you baptized?” And they said, “Into the baptism of John.”


## Acts 19:4 (id: 944019004)

4But Paul replied, “John baptized a baptism of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe in the one coming after him, that is, in Jesus.”


## Acts 19:5 (id: 944019005)

5And having heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.


## Acts 19:6 (id: 944019006)

6And Paul having laid hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them and they were speaking in languages and prophesying.


## Acts 19:7 (id: 944019007)

7And they all were about 12 men.


## Acts 19:8 (id: 944019008)

8And going into the synagogue, he was speaking boldly for three months, reasoning and persuading about the kingdom of God.


## Acts 19:9 (id: 944019009)

9But when some were being hardened and disobeying, speaking evil of the Way before the multitude, departing from them, he separated the disciples, reasoning each day in the school of Tyrannus.


## Acts 19:10 (id: 944019010)

10And this happened for two years, so that all living in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.


## Acts 19:11 (id: 944019011)

11And God was doing not ordinary miracles by the hands of Paul,


## Acts 19:12 (id: 944019012)

12so that even handkerchiefs or aprons from his skin were taken to the sick and {their} illnesses departed from them, and the evil spirits came out.


## Acts 19:13 (id: 944019013)

13Now some of the traveling Jewish exorcists also tried to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over the ones having evil spirits, saying, “I adjure you by the Jesus whom Paul proclaims.”


## Acts 19:14 (id: 944019014)

14(Now seven sons of Sceva, a certain Jewish chief priest, were doing this.)


## Acts 19:15 (id: 944019015)

15But answering, the evil spirit said to them, “Jesus I acknowledge, and Paul I know, but you, who are you?”


## Acts 19:16 (id: 944019016)

16And the man in whom was the evil spirit, leaping on them, overpowering them both, prevailed against them, so that they fled from that house naked and wounded.


## Acts 19:17 (id: 944019017)

17And this became known to all living in Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks. And fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was being magnified.


## Acts 19:18 (id: 944019018)

18And many of the ones having believed were coming, confessing and declaring their deeds.


## Acts 19:19 (id: 944019019)

19And many of the ones practicing the magical arts, bringing together {their} books, were burning them before everyone. And they calculated the value of them, and they found {it to be} five myriad pieces of silver.


## Acts 19:20 (id: 944019020)

20So with power the word of the Lord was increasing and prevailing.


## Acts 19:21 (id: 944019021)

21Now when these things were fulfilled, Paul determined in the Spirit to travel to Jerusalem, passing through Macedonia and Achaia, saying, “After I have been there, it is necessary for me also to see Rome.”


## Acts 19:22 (id: 944019022)

22And sending to Macedonia two of the ones helping him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a time.


## Acts 19:23 (id: 944019023)

23But at that time, no small disturbance happened concerning the Way.


## Acts 19:24 (id: 944019024)

24For a certain silversmith making silver shrines of Artemis, Demetrius by name, was bringing not a little business to the craftsmen,


## Acts 19:25 (id: 944019025)

25whom, having gathered together, and the workers about such things, said, “Men, you know that our prosperity is from this business.


## Acts 19:26 (id: 944019026)

26And you see and hear that not only in Ephesus but in almost all of Asia this Paul, having persuaded, has removed a considerable crowd, saying that the things coming into being through hands are not gods.


## Acts 19:27 (id: 944019027)

27And not only is this in peril, our trade to come to disrepute, but even the temple of the great goddess Artemis to be considered as nothing. And indeed, her majesty is about to be destroyed, whom all Asia, indeed the world, worships.”


## Acts 19:28 (id: 944019028)

28And hearing this and becoming full of anger, they were shouting, saying, “Great {is} Artemis of the Ephesians.”


## Acts 19:29 (id: 944019029)

29And the city was filled with confusion, and they rushed unanimously into the theater, having seized Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians, travel companions of Paul.


## Acts 19:30 (id: 944019030)

30But when Paul was desiring to enter among the people, the disciples were not permitting him.


## Acts 19:31 (id: 944019031)

31And also some of the Asiarchs, being friends to him, sending to him, were urging him not to give himself into the theater.


## Acts 19:32 (id: 944019032)

32Then indeed different ones were shouting something different, for the assembly was confused, and the majority did not know for what reason they had come together.


## Acts 19:33 (id: 944019033)

33And {some} from the crowd instructed Alexander, the Jews having pushed him forward, and Alexander, waving {his} hand, was wanting to give a defense to the people.


## Acts 19:34 (id: 944019034)

34But recognizing that he was a Jew, one voice happened from {them} all, while shouting for two hours, “Great {is} Artemis of the Ephesians.”


## Acts 19:35 (id: 944019035)

35But quieting the crowd, the city clerk says, “Men, Ephesians, for who is there of men who does not know the Ephesian city to be the temple keeper of the great Artemis and of the Zeus\-fallen image?


## Acts 19:36 (id: 944019036)

36These things, then, being undeniable, it is necessary for you to be calmed and to do nothing rash.


## Acts 19:37 (id: 944019037)

37For you brought these men {who are} neither temple\-robbers nor blasphemers of our goddess.


## Acts 19:38 (id: 944019038)

38Therefore indeed, if Demetrius and the craftsmen with him have a word against anyone, the courts are being conducted and there are proconsuls; let them accuse one another.


## Acts 19:39 (id: 944019039)

39But if you seek anything about other matters, it will be settled in the regular assembly.


## Acts 19:40 (id: 944019040)

40For indeed we are in danger of being accused of rioting concerning the today, there being no cause about which we will be able to give an account concerning this disorder.”


## Acts 19:41 (id: 944019041)

41And having said these things, he dismissed the assembly.


## Acts 20:1 (id: 944020001)

1And after the uproar had ended, Paul, having summoned the disciples and encouraged them, saying farewell, departed to go to Macedonia.


## Acts 20:2 (id: 944020002)

2And having gone through those regions and having exhorted them with many a word, he came to Greece.


## Acts 20:3 (id: 944020003)

3And having stayed three months there, a plot by the Jews happening against him being about to sail to Syria, it happened that he returned of a resolution through Macedonia.


## Acts 20:4 (id: 944020004)

4And Sopater of Pyrrhus, a Berean, and Aristarchus and Secundus of the Thessalonians, and Gaius, a Derbean, and Timothy and Tychicus and Trophimus, Asians, were accompanying him.


## Acts 20:5 (id: 944020005)

5But they, having gone ahead, were waiting for us at Troas.


## Acts 20:6 (id: 944020006)

6And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread, and in five days we came to them in Troas, where we stayed for seven days.


## Acts 20:7 (id: 944020007)

7And on the first of the week, we having been gathered together to break bread, Paul was speaking with them. Being about to depart the next day, he was thus continuing the word until midnight.


## Acts 20:8 (id: 944020008)

8And many lamps were in the upper room where we were gathered together.


## Acts 20:9 (id: 944020009)

9And a certain young man, Eutychus by name, sitting on the window, being overcome by a deep sleep, Paul speaking even longer, having been overcome by sleep, he fell down from the third story and was picked up dead.


## Acts 20:10 (id: 944020010)

10But Paul, going down, stretched out on him and, having embraced him, said, “Do not be troubled, for his life is in him.”


## Acts 20:11 (id: 944020011)

11And having gone up and having broken bread and having tasted, and having conversed for much {time} until dawn, thus he left.


## Acts 20:12 (id: 944020012)

12But they brought the boy alive and were comforted not moderately.


## Acts 20:13 (id: 944020013)

13Then we, having gone ahead to the ship, sailed away to Assos, intending to take Paul on board there, for thus he had arranged, intending to go on foot himself.


## Acts 20:14 (id: 944020014)

14And when he met us at Assos, taking him on board, we went to Mitylene.


## Acts 20:15 (id: 944020015)

15And having sailed from there, we came down on the next day opposite Chios, and on the other day, we arrived at Samos, and on the following day, we came to Miletus.


## Acts 20:16 (id: 944020016)

16For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus, so that it would not happen to him to lose time in Asia, for he was hurrying, if it might be possible for him, to be in Jerusalem for the day of Pentecost.


## Acts 20:17 (id: 944020017)

17And from Miletus, sending to Ephesus, he summoned the elders of the church.


## Acts 20:18 (id: 944020018)

18And when they came to him, he said to them, “You know, from the first day from which I set foot in Asia, how I was with you the whole time,


## Acts 20:19 (id: 944020019)

19serving the Lord with all humility and tears and trials happening to me in the plots of the Jews,


## Acts 20:20 (id: 944020020)

20how I withheld nothing being useful in order not to declare it to you, and I taught you in public and by houses,


## Acts 20:21 (id: 944020021)

21testifying to both Jews and Greeks repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus.


## Acts 20:22 (id: 944020022)

22And now, behold, I am going to Jerusalem, having been bound by the Spirit, not knowing the things that will happen to me in her,


## Acts 20:23 (id: 944020023)

23except that the Holy Spirit testifies to me by city, saying that chains and afflictions await me.


## Acts 20:24 (id: 944020024)

24But of no word do I consider my life valuable to myself, so as to finish my race and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus, to attest the gospel of the grace of God.


## Acts 20:25 (id: 944020025)

25And now, behold, I know that you all, among whom I went about proclaiming the kingdom, will see my face no more.


## Acts 20:26 (id: 944020026)

26Therefore I testify to you in the today day that I am innocent from the blood of all.


## Acts 20:27 (id: 944020027)

27For I did not hold back in order not to declare to you all the counsel of God.


## Acts 20:28 (id: 944020028)

28Guard yourselves and all the flock among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers to shepherd the church of God, which he obtained through his own blood.


## Acts 20:29 (id: 944020029)

29I know that after my departure, vicious wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock.


## Acts 20:30 (id: 944020030)

30Even from you yourselves, men will arise speaking perverted things in order to draw away the disciples after them.


## Acts 20:31 (id: 944020031)

31So be alert, remembering that for three years I did not stop admonishing each one with tears night and day.


## Acts 20:32 (id: 944020032)

32And now I am entrusting you to God and to the word of his grace being able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all the ones having been sanctified.


## Acts 20:33 (id: 944020033)

33I coveted the silver or gold or clothing of no one.


## Acts 20:34 (id: 944020034)

34You yourselves know that these hands ministered to my needs and to the ones being with me.


## Acts 20:35 (id: 944020035)

35I showed you all things, that it is necessary, working hard in this way, to take hold of the ones being weak and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that he himself said, ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.’”


## Acts 20:36 (id: 944020036)

36And having said these things, bowing his knees, he prayed with them all.


## Acts 20:37 (id: 944020037)

37But much weeping happened among them all, and falling upon the neck of Paul, they were kissing him,


## Acts 20:38 (id: 944020038)

38grieving mostly at the word that he had spoken, that they were going to see his face no more. Then they escorted him to the ship.


## Acts 21:1 (id: 944021001)

1And it happened that as we put to sea, having been parted from them, running a straight course, we came to Cos, and on the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara.


## Acts 21:2 (id: 944021002)

2And finding a ship crossing over to Phoenicia, going aboard, we put to sea.


## Acts 21:3 (id: 944021003)

3And having sighted Cyprus and having left it behind on the port side, we sailed to Syria and came down to Tyre, for there the ship was unloading {its} cargo.


## Acts 21:4 (id: 944021004)

4And having found the disciples, we stayed there seven days, who were saying to Paul through the Spirit not to set foot in Jerusalem.


## Acts 21:5 (id: 944021005)

5And when it happened that we had finished the days, having gone out, we were proceeding, everyone accompanying us with wives and children as far as outside the city, and having put down {our} knees on the shore {and} having prayed,


## Acts 21:6 (id: 944021006)

6we said farewell to each other and we went up into the ship and those returned to {their} own homes,


## Acts 21:7 (id: 944021007)

7but we, having finished the voyage from Tyre, came down to Ptolemais, and having greeted the brothers, we stayed with them for one day.


## Acts 21:8 (id: 944021008)

8And on the next day, having departed, we went to Caesarea and, entering into the house of Philip the Evangelist, who was from the Seven, we stayed with him.


## Acts 21:9 (id: 944021009)

9Now to this one were four daughters, virgins, prophesying.


## Acts 21:10 (id: 944021010)

10And as we stayed for many days, a certain prophet, Agabus by name, came down from Judea.


## Acts 21:11 (id: 944021011)

11And having come to us and having taken the belt of Paul, having bound his own feet and hands, he said, “The Holy Spirit says these things: ‘Thus will the Jews in Jerusalem bind the man of whom is this belt, and they will deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.’”


## Acts 21:12 (id: 944021012)

12And when we heard these things, both we and the locals were urging him not to go up to Jerusalem.


## Acts 21:13 (id: 944021013)

13Then Paul answered, “What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound but also to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.”


## Acts 21:14 (id: 944021014)

14And as he was not being persuaded, we kept quiet, saying, “Let the will of the Lord happen.”


## Acts 21:15 (id: 944021015)

15And after these days, having equipped ourselves, we went up to Jerusalem.


## Acts 21:16 (id: 944021016)

16And {some} of the disciples from Caesarea also came with us, bringing us to Mnason, a certain Cypriot, an early disciple, with whom we would be hosted.


## Acts 21:17 (id: 944021017)

17And when we had arrived in Jerusalem, the brothers welcomed us gladly.


## Acts 21:18 (id: 944021018)

18And on the next day Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present.


## Acts 21:19 (id: 944021019)

19And having greeted them, he was declaring, one by one, each of the things God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry.


## Acts 21:20 (id: 944021020)

20And having heard it, they were glorifying God, and they said to him, “You see, brother, how many myriads of those having believed there are among the Jews, and they are all zealous for the law.


## Acts 21:21 (id: 944021021)

21And they have been told about you that you teach all the Jews among the Gentiles apostasy from Moses, telling them not to circumcise {their} children, nor to walk in the customs.


## Acts 21:22 (id: 944021022)

22What therefore is it? They will certainly hear that you have come.


## Acts 21:23 (id: 944021023)

23So do this that we say to you. Four men are with us having a vow from themselves.


## Acts 21:24 (id: 944021024)

24Taking these men, be purified with them and pay the expenses for them, so that they will shear {their} heads, and then everyone will know that there is nothing in the things they have been told about you, but that you conform, also keeping the law yourself.


## Acts 21:25 (id: 944021025)

25But concerning the Gentiles having believed, having judged, we sent that they should guard the idol\-sacrificed and blood and the strangled and sexual immorality.”


## Acts 21:26 (id: 944021026)

26Then Paul, having taken the men, having been purified with them the next day, was going into the temple declaring the fulfillment of the days of purification, until the offering was offered for each one of them.


## Acts 21:27 (id: 944021027)

27But when the seven days were about to be finished, the Jews from Asia, seeing Paul in the temple, were agitating the whole crowd, and they laid {their} hands on him,


## Acts 21:28 (id: 944021028)

28shouting, “Men, Israelites, help! This is the man teaching all everywhere against the people and the law and this place. And he has even both brought Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place.”


## Acts 21:29 (id: 944021029)

29For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city, whom they were thinking that Paul had brought into the temple.


## Acts 21:30 (id: 944021030)

30And the whole city was excited, and a mob of the people happened, and having taken hold of Paul, they were dragging him outside of the temple, and immediately the doors were shut.


## Acts 21:31 (id: 944021031)

31And as they were seeking to kill him, a report came up to the chiliarch of the cohort that all Jerusalem was agitated,


## Acts 21:32 (id: 944021032)

32who, immediately taking soldiers and centurions, ran down to them. And they, seeing the chiliarch and the soldiers, stopped beating Paul.


## Acts 21:33 (id: 944021033)

33Then, approaching, the commander took hold of him and commanded him to be bound with two chains, and he was asking who he might be and what he had done.


## Acts 21:34 (id: 944021034)

34But different ones in the crowd were shouting different things, and he, not being able to learn the certain because of the noise, ordered him to be brought into the fortress.


## Acts 21:35 (id: 944021035)

35But when he came to the steps, it happened that he was carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd.


## Acts 21:36 (id: 944021036)

36For the multitude of the people was following, shouting, “Take him away!”


## Acts 21:37 (id: 944021037)

37And being about to be brought into the fortress, Paul says to the chiliarch, “If it is permitted for me to say something to you?” But he said, “Do you know Greek?


## Acts 21:38 (id: 944021038)

38Then are you not the Egyptian having revolted before these days and having led 4,000 men of the Sicarii into the wilderness?”


## Acts 21:39 (id: 944021039)

39But Paul said, “I am a Jewish man, a Tarsian of Cilicia, a citizen of a not undistinguished city. And I ask of you, allow me to speak to the people.”


## Acts 21:40 (id: 944021040)

40And when he allowed, Paul, standing on the steps, motioned with {his} hand to the people. And when a deep silence happened, he spoke in the Hebrew language, saying,


## Acts 22:1 (id: 944022001)

1“Men, brothers and fathers, hear my defense to you now.”


## Acts 22:2 (id: 944022002)

2And when they heard that he was speaking to them in the Hebrew language, they granted more quietness. And he said,


## Acts 22:3 (id: 944022003)

3“I am a Jewish man, born in Tarsus of Cilicia but educated in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, instructed according to the strictness of the law of our fathers, being zealous for God, as you all are today,


## Acts 22:4 (id: 944022004)

4who persecuted this Way unto death, binding and delivering to prison both men and women,


## Acts 22:5 (id: 944022005)

5as also the high priest testifies for me, and all the elderhood, from whom also having received letters to the brothers, I was traveling to Damascus, going to bring back bound to Jerusalem even those being there so that they might be punished.


## Acts 22:6 (id: 944022006)

6And it happened to me that, traveling and nearing Damascus about noon, suddenly a great light from heaven shone around me.


## Acts 22:7 (id: 944022007)

7And I fell to the ground and I heard a voice saying to me, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?’


## Acts 22:8 (id: 944022008)

8And I answered, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ And he said to me, ‘I am Jesus the Nazarene, whom you are persecuting.’


## Acts 22:9 (id: 944022009)

9Now the ones being with me saw the light, but they did not hear the voice of the one speaking to me.


## Acts 22:10 (id: 944022010)

10But I said, ‘What should I do, Lord?’ And the Lord said to me, ‘Arising, go into Damascus, and there it will be told to you about all that has been appointed to you to do.’


## Acts 22:11 (id: 944022011)

11And as I was not seeing clearly because of the glory of that light, being led by the hand by the ones being with me, I came into Damascus.


## Acts 22:12 (id: 944022012)

12And Ananias, a certain devout man according to the law, being attested by all the Jews living there,


## Acts 22:13 (id: 944022013)

13came to me and, standing by me, said to me, ‘Saul, brother, look up.’ And in the same hour I looked up to him.


## Acts 22:14 (id: 944022014)

14And he said, ‘The God of our fathers appointed you to know his will and to see the Righteous One and to hear the voice from his mouth,


## Acts 22:15 (id: 944022015)

15for you will be a witness for him to all men of what you have seen and heard.


## Acts 22:16 (id: 944022016)

16And now, why are you delaying? Arising, be baptized and wash away your sins, calling on his name.’


## Acts 22:17 (id: 944022017)

17And it happened to me that, having returned to Jerusalem, and as I was praying in the temple, I became in a trance.


## Acts 22:18 (id: 944022018)

18And I saw him saying to me, ‘Hurry and go away in haste from Jerusalem, because they will not accept your testimony about me.’


## Acts 22:19 (id: 944022019)

19And I said, ‘Lord, they themselves know that I was imprisoning and beating by synagogues the ones believing in you.


## Acts 22:20 (id: 944022020)

20And when the blood of Stephen your witness was spilled, I myself was also standing by and agreeing and guarding the outer garments of the ones killing him.’


## Acts 22:21 (id: 944022021)

21But he said to me, ‘Go, because I will send you far away to the Gentiles.’”


## Acts 22:22 (id: 944022022)

22And they were listening to him until this word, and they lifted up their voice, saying, “Remove such a one from the earth, for it was not right for him to live.”


## Acts 22:23 (id: 944022023)

23And as they were shouting and casting off {their} outer garments, and throwing dust into the air,


## Acts 22:24 (id: 944022024)

24the chiliarch ordered him to be brought into the fortress, commanding him to be examined by scourges, so that he might know for what reason they were shouting thus against him.


## Acts 22:25 (id: 944022025)

25But when they stretched him out for the whips, Paul said to the centurion standing by, “If it is lawful for you to scourge a man Roman and uncondemned?”


## Acts 22:26 (id: 944022026)

26And hearing this. the centurion, going to the chiliarch, reported, saying, “What are you about to do? For this man is a Roman.”


## Acts 22:27 (id: 944022027)

27So coming, the chiliarch said to him, “Tell me, are you a Roman?” And he said, “Yes.”


## Acts 22:28 (id: 944022028)

28And the commander answered, “I bought this citizenship with a large sum of money.” But Paul said, “But I indeed was born.”


## Acts 22:29 (id: 944022029)

29Then the ones being about to examine him drew back from him immediately, and the chiliarch also was afraid, having learned that he was a Roman, because indeed he had bound him.


## Acts 22:30 (id: 944022030)

30And on the next day, wanting to know the certain, why he was being accused by the Jews, he released him and commanded the chief priests and all the Sanhedrin to assemble. And having brought down Paul, he placed him among them.


## Acts 23:1 (id: 944023001)

1And looking intently at the Sanhedrin, Paul said, “Men, brothers, I have conducted myself toward God in all good conscience up to this day.”


## Acts 23:2 (id: 944023002)

2But Ananias the high priest commanded the ones standing by him to strike his mouth.


## Acts 23:3 (id: 944023003)

3Then Paul said to him, “God is about to strike you, you whitewashed wall! And do you sit judging me by the law and, acting contrary to the law, command me to be struck?”


## Acts 23:4 (id: 944023004)

4But the ones standing by said, “Are you insulting the high priest of God?”


## Acts 23:5 (id: 944023005)

5And Paul said, “I did not know, brothers, that he was the high priest. For it is written, ‘You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people.’”


## Acts 23:6 (id: 944023006)

6Then Paul, realizing that one part was Sadducees and the other Pharisees, shouted in the Sanhedrin, “Men, brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees; concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead I am being judged.”


## Acts 23:7 (id: 944023007)

7And when he said this, an argument happened between the Pharisees and Sadducees, and the multitude was divided.


## Acts 23:8 (id: 944023008)

8For Sadducees say there is no resurrection, nor angels or spirits, but Pharisees confess both.


## Acts 23:9 (id: 944023009)

9So a great uproar happened, and arising, some of the scribes of the party of the Pharisees were contending, saying, “We find nothing evil in this man. And if a spirit spoke to him, or an angel …”


## Acts 23:10 (id: 944023010)

10And when a great argument happened, the chiliarch, fearing lest Paul be torn apart by them, ordered the soldiers to go down to seize him from the midst of them and to bring him into the fortress.


## Acts 23:11 (id: 944023011)

11But on the following night, the Lord, having stood beside him, said, “Be courageous, for as you have attested the things concerning me in Jerusalem, so it is necessary also for you to testify in Rome.”


## Acts 23:12 (id: 944023012)

12And when day came, the Jews, making a conspiracy, cursed themselves, saying neither to eat nor to drink until they had killed Paul.


## Acts 23:13 (id: 944023013)

13And the ones having made this conspiracy were more than 40,


## Acts 23:14 (id: 944023014)

14who, going to the chief priests and the elders, said, “We have cursed ourselves with a curse, to eat nothing until we have killed Paul.


## Acts 23:15 (id: 944023015)

15Now, therefore, you, with the Sanhedrin, appear to the chiliarch as if you are going to examine more thoroughly the things concerning him, so that he may bring him down to you. But we are ready to kill him before he arrives.”


## Acts 23:16 (id: 944023016)

16But hearing the ambush, the son of the sister of Paul, going and entering into the fortress, reported it to Paul.


## Acts 23:17 (id: 944023017)

17So calling one of the centurions, Paul said, “Take this young man to the chiliarch, for he has something to report to him.”


## Acts 23:18 (id: 944023018)

18So taking him, he brought him to the chiliarch and says, “The prisoner, Paul, having summoned me, asked me to bring to you this young man having something to say to you.”


## Acts 23:19 (id: 944023019)

19So the chiliarch, taking hold of his hand and withdrawing, was asking him in private, “What is it that you have to report to me?”


## Acts 23:20 (id: 944023020)

20So he said, “The Jews have agreed to ask you that tomorrow you might bring Paul down to the Sanhedrin, as if they were going to investigate something about him more thoroughly.


## Acts 23:21 (id: 944023021)

21Therefore may you not be persuaded by them, because from them more than 40 men wait in ambush for him, who have cursed themselves neither to eat nor to drink until they have killed him. Even now they are ready, waiting for the promise from you.”


## Acts 23:22 (id: 944023022)

22So the chiliarch dismissed the young man, commanding him to tell no one that “you have reported these things to me.”


## Acts 23:23 (id: 944023023)

23And summoning a certain two of the centurions, he said, “Prepare 200 soldiers and 70 horsemen and 200 spearmen so that they might go to Caesarea at the third hour of the night,”


## Acts 23:24 (id: 944023024)

24and to provide animals so that, having set Paul on them, they may bring him safely to Felix the governor,


## Acts 23:25 (id: 944023025)

25writing a letter, having this form:


## Acts 23:26 (id: 944023026)

26“Claudius Lysias to the most excellent Governor Felix: Greetings.


## Acts 23:27 (id: 944023027)

27This man, having been seized by the Jews and about to be killed by them, coming with a detachment of soldiers, I rescued, having learned that he was a Roman.


## Acts 23:28 (id: 944023028)

28And wanting to know the charge with which they were accusing him, I took him down to their Sanhedrin,


## Acts 23:29 (id: 944023029)

29whom I found being accused about questions of their law but having no accusation worthy of death or chains.


## Acts 23:30 (id: 944023030)

30And when a plot that was to be against the man was revealed to me, immediately I sent him to you, also commanding the accusers to speak against him to you.”


## Acts 23:31 (id: 944023031)

31So the soldiers, according to the thing having been commanded to them, taking Paul, brought him by night to Antipatris.


## Acts 23:32 (id: 944023032)

32And on the next day they returned to the fortress, allowing the horsemen to go away with him,


## Acts 23:33 (id: 944023033)

33who, entering into Caesarea and delivering the letter to the governor, also presented Paul to him.


## Acts 23:34 (id: 944023034)

34And having read the letter and having asked what province he was from and having learned that {he was} from Cilicia,


## Acts 23:35 (id: 944023035)

35he said, “I will hear you fully when your accusers may also come,” commanding him to be guarded in the palace of Herod.


## Acts 24:1 (id: 944024001)

1And after five days, Ananias, the high priest, with certain elders and a certain orator, Tertullus, came down, who appeared to the governor against Paul.


## Acts 24:2 (id: 944024002)

2And when he had been summoned, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, “As we are obtaining great peace through you, and as reforms are happening for this people through your foresight


## Acts 24:3 (id: 944024003)

3both in every way and everywhere, we receive {these things}, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.


## Acts 24:4 (id: 944024004)

4But so that I may not detain you further, I ask you to listen to us briefly in your fairness.


## Acts 24:5 (id: 944024005)

5For having found this man a pest and one inciting rebellion among all the Jews throughout the world and a leader of the sect of the Nazarenes,


## Acts 24:6 (id: 944024006)

6who even tried to desecrate the temple, whom also we arrested; \[and we wanted to judge him according to our law,


## Acts 24:7 (id: 944024007)

7but Lysias, the chiliarch, coming with much force, took him away from our hands,


## Acts 24:8 (id: 944024008)

8commanding his accusers to come to you;] from whom, having inquired about all these things, you yourself will be able to learn of what things we are accusing him.”


## Acts 24:9 (id: 944024009)

9And the Jews also agreed, affirming these things to be thus.


## Acts 24:10 (id: 944024010)

10And Paul answered, the governor having motioned for him to speak, “Knowing you to have been a judge to this nation for many years, I gladly make my defense about the things concerning me,


## Acts 24:11 (id: 944024011)

11you being able to learn that it is not more than 12 days for me from when I went up to Jerusalem to worship,


## Acts 24:12 (id: 944024012)

12and they found me neither in the temple arguing with anyone, nor causing a rebellion of the crowd, not in the synagogues, and not throughout the city,


## Acts 24:13 (id: 944024013)

13and they are not able to prove {the things} to you about which they are now accusing me.


## Acts 24:14 (id: 944024014)

14But I confess this to you, that according to the Way that they call a sect, thus I serve the fathers’ God, being faithful to all the things according to the law and the things written in the Prophets,


## Acts 24:15 (id: 944024015)

15having a hope in God that these themselves also accept, that there is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous.


## Acts 24:16 (id: 944024016)

16In this I myself also strive to have a blameless conscience before God and men continually.


## Acts 24:17 (id: 944024017)

17Now after many years I came to my nation bringing alms and offerings,


## Acts 24:18 (id: 944024018)

18in which they found me in the temple, having been cleansed, not with a crowd, nor with an uproar.


## Acts 24:19 (id: 944024019)

19But certain Jews from Asia—who ought to be present before you and make accusations if they have anything against me.


## Acts 24:20 (id: 944024020)

20Or let these themselves say what wrong they found when I stood before the Sanhedrin,


## Acts 24:21 (id: 944024021)

21{other} than regarding this one utterance that I shouted out standing among them, ‘Concerning the resurrection of the dead I am being judged by you today!’”


## Acts 24:22 (id: 944024022)

22Then Felix, knowing more accurately the things concerning the Way, adjourned them, saying, “When Lysias the chiliarch may come down, I will decide the things concerning you,”


## Acts 24:23 (id: 944024023)

23commanding the centurion to guard him and for him to have freedom and to forbid none of his own to minister to him.


## Acts 24:24 (id: 944024024)

24But after some days Felix, returning with Drusilla, his own wife, being a Jewess, summoned Paul and heard him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus.


## Acts 24:25 (id: 944024025)

25But as he was reasoning about righteousness and self\-control and the coming judgment, Felix, becoming frightened, answered, “Go away for now, but having found time, I will summon you,”


## Acts 24:26 (id: 944024026)

26also hoping at the same time that money would be given to him by Paul, and therefore summoning him often, he was speaking with him.


## Acts 24:27 (id: 944024027)

27But two years being fulfilled, Felix received a successor, Porcius Festus, and wanting to gain favor with the Jews, Felix left Paul bound.


## Acts 25:1 (id: 944025001)

1Now Festus, having set foot in the province, went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem after three days.


## Acts 25:2 (id: 944025002)

2And the chief priests and the first of the Jews appeared to him against Paul, and they were begging him,


## Acts 25:3 (id: 944025003)

3requesting a favor against him, that he might summon him to Jerusalem, making an ambush to kill him along the way.


## Acts 25:4 (id: 944025004)

4Then Festus answered that Paul was being held at Caesarea but that he himself was about to depart soon.


## Acts 25:5 (id: 944025005)

5He said, “Therefore, the powerful among you, having come down together, if there is something wrong with the man, let them accuse him.”


## Acts 25:6 (id: 944025006)

6And having stayed with them not more than eight or ten days, he went down to Caesarea. On the next day, having sat in the judgment seat, he commanded Paul to be brought.


## Acts 25:7 (id: 944025007)

7And when he had come, the Jews having come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing many and serious charges that they were not able to prove,


## Acts 25:8 (id: 944025008)

8as Paul was saying in defense, “Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar have I committed any sin.”


## Acts 25:9 (id: 944025009)

9But Festus, wanting to lay down a favor for the Jews, answering Paul, said, “Are you willing, having gone up to Jerusalem, to be judged before me there about these things?”


## Acts 25:10 (id: 944025010)

10But Paul said, “I am standing before the judgment seat of Caesar, where it is necessary for me to be judged. I have done no harm to the Jews, as you also know very well.


## Acts 25:11 (id: 944025011)

11Therefore, if I am doing harm and have done something worthy of death, I do not refuse to die. But if {the things} of which they are accusing me are nothing, no one is able to give me to them as a favor. I appeal to Caesar!”


## Acts 25:12 (id: 944025012)

12Then Festus, having spoken with the council, answered, “To Caesar you have appealed, to Caesar you will go!”


## Acts 25:13 (id: 944025013)

13Now after some days had passed, King Agrippa and Bernice, having come down to Caesarea, greeted Festus.


## Acts 25:14 (id: 944025014)

14And as they were staying there for many days, Festus presented to the king the things concerning Paul, saying, “A certain man has been left a prisoner by Felix,


## Acts 25:15 (id: 944025015)

15about whom, when I was in Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews appeared, requesting a judgment against him.


## Acts 25:16 (id: 944025016)

16to whom I replied that the custom of the Romans is not to give any man as a favor before the one being accused may have the accusers by face and receive an opportunity of a defense concerning the accusation.


## Acts 25:17 (id: 944025017)

17Therefore, when they had come together here, causing no delay, the next day, having sat in the judgment seat, I commanded the man to be brought,


## Acts 25:18 (id: 944025018)

18about whom the accusers, having stood up, brought no charge of the evils that I was expecting.


## Acts 25:19 (id: 944025019)

19Instead, they were having certain disputes with him about their own religion and about a certain Jesus, having died, whom Paul asserted to be alive.


## Acts 25:20 (id: 944025020)

20And I, doubting the investigation about these things, asked if he might be willing to go to Jerusalem and be judged there about these things.


## Acts 25:21 (id: 944025021)

21But when Paul appealed that he be kept for the decision of the August one, I commanded him to be kept until I might send him to Caesar.”


## Acts 25:22 (id: 944025022)

22And Agrippa {replied} to Festus, “I myself was also wanting to hear this man.” “Tomorrow,” he says, “you will hear him.”


## Acts 25:23 (id: 944025023)

23So on the next day, Agrippa and Bernice having come with much ceremony and having entered into the hall with both chiliarchs and men of distinction of the city, then, having been commanded by Festus, Paul was brought.


## Acts 25:24 (id: 944025024)

24And Festus said, “King Agrippa and all the men being present with us, you see this one concerning whom the whole multitude of the Jews petitioned me both in Jerusalem and here, shouting that he ought not to live any longer.


## Acts 25:25 (id: 944025025)

25But I learned that he had done nothing worthy of death. But this one himself having appealed to the August one, I decided to send him,


## Acts 25:26 (id: 944025026)

26about whom I do not have anything definite to write to the lord. Therefore I have brought him before you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that, the examination having happened, I might have something that I might write.


## Acts 25:27 (id: 944025027)

27For it seems unreasonable to me, sending a prisoner and not to signify the charges against him.”


## Acts 26:1 (id: 944026001)

1And Agrippa said to Paul, “It is permitted to you to speak about yourself.” Then Paul, stretching out {his} hand, was defending himself:


## Acts 26:2 (id: 944026002)

2“Concerning all the things of which I am accused by the Jews, King Agrippa, I consider myself blessed to be about to defend myself before you today,


## Acts 26:3 (id: 944026003)

3especially you being an expert in all the customs and controversies among the Jews. So I ask you to hear me patiently.


## Acts 26:4 (id: 944026004)

4Indeed, then, all the Jews know the manner of my life from my youth, having happened from the beginning in my nation and in Jerusalem,


## Acts 26:5 (id: 944026005)

5knowing me from the beginning, if they wished to testify, that according to the strictest sect of our religion I lived as a Pharisee.


## Acts 26:6 (id: 944026006)

6And now I stand here being judged because of hope of the promise made to our fathers by God,


## Acts 26:7 (id: 944026007)

7to which our 12 tribes hope to attain, serving in earnestness night and day, concerning which hope I am being accused by the Jews, O King.


## Acts 26:8 (id: 944026008)

8Why is it judged unbelievable among you if God raises the dead?


## Acts 26:9 (id: 944026009)

9Indeed, for myself, I thought it to be necessary to do many things opposed to the name of Jesus the Nazarene,


## Acts 26:10 (id: 944026010)

10which I did even in Jerusalem, and I even locked up many of the saints in prisons, having received authority from the chief priests, and when they were being executed, I cast my vote against them.


## Acts 26:11 (id: 944026011)

11And often punishing them in all the synagogues, I forced them to blaspheme, and being greatly enraged against them, I persecuted them even as far as to other cities,


## Acts 26:12 (id: 944026012)

12in which things, traveling to Damascus with authority and a commission from the chief priests,


## Acts 26:13 (id: 944026013)

13in the middle of the day, along the road, I saw, O King, a light from heaven, beyond the brightness of the sun, shining around me and the ones traveling with me.


## Acts 26:14 (id: 944026014)

14And when we all had fallen to the ground, I heard a voice speaking to me in the Hebrew language, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It is hard for you to kick against a goad.’


## Acts 26:15 (id: 944026015)

15And I said, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ And the Lord said, ‘I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.


## Acts 26:16 (id: 944026016)

16But get up and stand on your feet, because for this I have appeared to you, to appoint you a servant and a witness both of the things in which you have seen me and of the things in which I will be shown to you,


## Acts 26:17 (id: 944026017)

17rescuing you from the people and from the Gentiles, to whom I am sending you,


## Acts 26:18 (id: 944026018)

18to open their eyes to turn from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God, for them to receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among the ones having been sanctified by faith in me.’


## Acts 26:19 (id: 944026019)

19Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,


## Acts 26:20 (id: 944026020)

20but first to the ones in Damascus and also in Jerusalem and the whole region of Judea and to the Gentiles I declared to repent and turn to God, doing deeds worthy of repentance.


## Acts 26:21 (id: 944026021)

21Because of these things, the Jews, having seized me in the temple, were trying to kill me.


## Acts 26:22 (id: 944026022)

22Therefore, having received help from God up to this day, I stand, testifying to both small and great, saying nothing except the things that both the prophets and Moses said were going to happen—


## Acts 26:23 (id: 944026023)

23if the Christ would be a sufferer, if he, the first from the resurrection of the dead, was going to proclaim light both to the people and to the Gentiles.”


## Acts 26:24 (id: 944026024)

24And as he was saying these things in his defense, Festus says in a loud voice, “Paul, you are insane! Great learning is turning you to insanity.”


## Acts 26:25 (id: 944026025)

25But Paul says, “I am not insane, most excellent Festus, but I am speaking words of truth and of sanity.


## Acts 26:26 (id: 944026026)

26For the king knows about these things—to whom indeed, speaking boldly, I am talking—for I am not persuaded at all that any of these things eludes him, for this has not been done in a corner.


## Acts 26:27 (id: 944026027)

27Do you believe the prophets, King Agrippa? I know that you believe.”


## Acts 26:28 (id: 944026028)

28But Agrippa said to Paul, “In little are you persuading me to make me a Christian?”


## Acts 26:29 (id: 944026029)

29But Paul replied, “I would wish to God, either in little or in much, that not only you but also all the ones hearing me today would become such as I also am—without these chains.”


## Acts 26:30 (id: 944026030)

30Then the king got up, and the governor and Bernice and the ones sitting with them,


## Acts 26:31 (id: 944026031)

31and having left, they were talking to one another, saying, “This man is not doing anything worthy of death or of chains.”


## Acts 26:32 (id: 944026032)

32And Agrippa said to Festus, “This man was able to have been released if he had not appealed to Caesar.”


## Acts 27:1 (id: 944027001)

1And when it was decided for us to sail to Italy, they were delivering both Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion, Julius by name, of the Augustan regiment.


## Acts 27:2 (id: 944027002)

2And having boarded a ship from Adramyttium being about to sail to places along Asia, we put to sea, Aristarchus, a Macedonian, a Thessalonian, being with us.


## Acts 27:3 (id: 944027003)

3And on the next day, we came down to Sidon, and Julius, treating Paul kindly, allowed him, going to {his} friends, to receive {their} care.


## Acts 27:4 (id: 944027004)

4And from there, having put to sea, we sailed under Cyprus because the winds were contrary.


## Acts 27:5 (id: 944027005)

5And having sailed across the sea along Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came down to Myra of Lycia.


## Acts 27:6 (id: 944027006)

6And there, the centurion having found an Alexandrian ship sailing to Italy, he put us on it.


## Acts 27:7 (id: 944027007)

7And sailing slowly for many days and having arrived with difficulty near Cnidus, the wind not permitting us further, we sailed along Crete opposite Salmone.


## Acts 27:8 (id: 944027008)

8And sailing along it with difficulty, we came to a certain place called Fair Havens, which was near the city of Lasea.


## Acts 27:9 (id: 944027009)

9But much time having passed, and the voyage already being dangerous because even the fast had already passed, Paul was warning them,


## Acts 27:10 (id: 944027010)

10saying to them, “Men, I see that the voyage is about to be with injury and much loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives.”


## Acts 27:11 (id: 944027011)

11But the centurion was being persuaded more by the pilot and by the captain than by the things being spoken by Paul.


## Acts 27:12 (id: 944027012)

12But the harbor being unsuitable for wintering, the majority gave counsel to sail from there, if somehow they might be able to come down to Phoenix, a harbor in Crete looking according to the southwest wind and according to the northwest wind, to winter there.


## Acts 27:13 (id: 944027013)

13And as a south wind was blowing gently, thinking to have obtained {their} purpose, having raised {the anchor}, they were sailing along close to Crete.


## Acts 27:14 (id: 944027014)

14But after not long, a tempestuous wind called Eurakylon rushed down from it.


## Acts 27:15 (id: 944027015)

15And the ship having been seized and not being able to face into the wind, having given way, we were driven along.


## Acts 27:16 (id: 944027016)

16But running under a certain island called Cauda, we were able with difficulty to become controllers of the lifeboat,


## Acts 27:17 (id: 944027017)

17which having hoisted up, they were using helps, undergirding the ship. And fearing lest they might fall into the Syrtis, lowering the gear, thus they were being driven along.


## Acts 27:18 (id: 944027018)

18But we being exceedingly storm\-tossed, on the next day they were doing a jettison.


## Acts 27:19 (id: 944027019)

19And on the third day they threw the equipment of the ship {overboard} with their own hands.


## Acts 27:20 (id: 944027020)

20But neither sun nor stars appearing for many days, and no small storm lying upon us, all hope for us to be saved was finally being taken away.


## Acts 27:21 (id: 944027021)

21And as there had been much abstinence, then Paul, having stood up in the midst of them, said, “O men, it was indeed necessary, obeying me, not to put to sea from Crete and to avoid this damage and loss.


## Acts 27:22 (id: 944027022)

22But now I urge you to take courage, for there will be no loss of life among you, only of the ship.


## Acts 27:23 (id: 944027023)

23For this night an angel of the God whose I am and whom I serve stood beside me,


## Acts 27:24 (id: 944027024)

24saying, ‘Do not be afraid, Paul. It is necessary for you to stand before Caesar, and behold, God has graciously granted to you all the ones sailing with you.’


## Acts 27:25 (id: 944027025)

25Therefore take courage, men! For I trust in God that it will be thus, according to the way it was told to me.


## Acts 27:26 (id: 944027026)

26But it is necessary for us to fall upon some island.”


## Acts 27:27 (id: 944027027)

27And when the fourteenth night happened, as we were being driven about in the Hadria, around the middle of the night the sailors were suspecting some land to be approaching them.


## Acts 27:28 (id: 944027028)

28And taking soundings, they found 20 fathoms, but having gone a little farther and taking soundings again, they found 15 fathoms.


## Acts 27:29 (id: 944027029)

29And fearing lest we might fall upon a rugged place somewhere, having lowered four anchors from the stern, they were praying for day to come.


## Acts 27:30 (id: 944027030)

30But as the sailors were seeking to flee from the ship, and as they had lowered the lifeboat into the sea on a pretext as if intending to lower anchors from the bow,


## Acts 27:31 (id: 944027031)

31Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, “If these do not stay in the ship, you are not able to be saved.”


## Acts 27:32 (id: 944027032)

32Then the soldiers cut the ropes of the lifeboat and let it fall away.


## Acts 27:33 (id: 944027033)

33And until day was about to come, Paul was urging them all to take food, saying, “Anxiously waiting for a fourteenth day today, you are continuing fasting, having eaten nothing.


## Acts 27:34 (id: 944027034)

34Therefore, I urge you to take food, for this is for your salvation. For a hair from the head of none of you will perish.”


## Acts 27:35 (id: 944027035)

35And having said this and having taken bread, he gave thanks to God before everyone and, having broken bread, he began to eat.


## Acts 27:36 (id: 944027036)

36And they were all encouraged and took food themselves.


## Acts 27:37 (id: 944027037)

37Now we, all the souls in the ship, were 276\.


## Acts 27:38 (id: 944027038)

38And having been satisfied with food, they were lightening the ship, throwing out the wheat into the sea.


## Acts 27:39 (id: 944027039)

39And when day came, they were not recognizing the land, but they were noticing a certain bay having a beach, onto which they were discussing whether they might be able to drive the ship.


## Acts 27:40 (id: 944027040)

40And having cut loose the anchors, they left them in the sea. At the same time, having loosened the bands of the rudders and having raised the topsail to the wind, they were heading to the beach.


## Acts 27:41 (id: 944027041)

41But having fallen into a place between two seas, the ship ran aground, and the bow of the ship, having stuck there, remained immovable, but the stern was being loosed by the violence.


## Acts 27:42 (id: 944027042)

42Now the plan of the soldiers was that they would kill the prisoners, lest any, swimming away, might escape.


## Acts 27:43 (id: 944027043)

43But the centurion, wanting to save Paul, stopped their plan, and he commanded the ones being able to swim to depart first to the land, jumping overboard,


## Acts 27:44 (id: 944027044)

44and the rest, some on planks, and some on certain things from the ship, and in this way it happened that all were brought safely to the land.


## Acts 28:1 (id: 944028001)

1And having been brought safely through, we then learned that the island was called Malta.


## Acts 28:2 (id: 944028002)

2And the barbarians were offering no ordinary benevolence to us, for, lighting a fire because of the impending rain and because of the cold, they welcomed us all.


## Acts 28:3 (id: 944028003)

3But when Paul had gathered a certain quantity of sticks and had placed them on the fire, a viper, coming out from the heat, seized his hand.


## Acts 28:4 (id: 944028004)

4And as the barbarians saw the creature hanging from his hand, they were saying to one another, “This man is certainly a murderer, whom, having been saved from the sea, Justice has not permitted to live.”


## Acts 28:5 (id: 944028005)

5Then he, shaking off the creature into the fire, suffered no harm.


## Acts 28:6 (id: 944028006)

6But they were expecting him to begin to be inflamed or suddenly to fall down dead. But as they watched for a long time and saw nothing unusual happening to him, turning themselves around, they said he was a god.


## Acts 28:7 (id: 944028007)

7Now in the {areas} around that place were lands of the first of the island, Publius by name, who, welcoming us, kindly entertained us for three days.


## Acts 28:8 (id: 944028008)

8And it happened that the father of Publius was lying sick, being afflicted with fevers and dysentery, to whom having gone in and having prayed, having placed {his} hands on him, Paul healed him.


## Acts 28:9 (id: 944028009)

9And this having happened, the others on the island having sicknesses were also coming and being healed.


## Acts 28:10 (id: 944028010)

10They also honored us with many honors, and they gave to us as we were putting to sea the things for {our} needs.


## Acts 28:11 (id: 944028011)

11And after three months, we put to sea in an Alexandrian ship with a Dioscouri figurehead having wintered at the island.


## Acts 28:12 (id: 944028012)

12And having come down to Syracuse, we stayed for three days.


## Acts 28:13 (id: 944028013)

13Having sailed from there, we came down to Rhegium, and after one day, a south wind having occurred, we came to Puteoli the next day,


## Acts 28:14 (id: 944028014)

14where, having found brothers, we were begged to stay with them for seven days, and thus we went towards Rome.


## Acts 28:15 (id: 944028015)

15From there, the brothers, having heard the things about us, came to a meeting with us as far as the Forum of Appius and Three Taverns, whom seeing, Paul, thanking God, took courage.


## Acts 28:16 (id: 944028016)

16And when we entered into Rome, Paul was allowed to stay by himself with the soldier guarding him.


## Acts 28:17 (id: 944028017)

17And it happened that after three days, he called together the ones being first among the Jews. And when they had come together, he said to them, “Men, brothers, having done nothing opposed to the people or to the fathers’ customs, I was delivered as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans,


## Acts 28:18 (id: 944028018)

18who, having questioned me, were intending to release me because there was no reason in me for death.


## Acts 28:19 (id: 944028019)

19But as the Jews were objecting, I was forced to appeal to Caesar—not as if having anything {of which} to accuse my nation.


## Acts 28:20 (id: 944028020)

20Therefore for this reason I summoned you, to see and to speak with you. For on account of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.”


## Acts 28:21 (id: 944028021)

21But they said to him, “We have not received letters from Judea about you, nor have any of the brothers, coming, reported or said anything evil about you.


## Acts 28:22 (id: 944028022)

22But we value to hear from you what you think, for concerning this sect, it is known to us that it is spoken against everywhere.”


## Acts 28:23 (id: 944028023)

23And having appointed a day for him, more came to him at his lodging, to whom he was explaining, testifying about the kingdom of God and persuading them about Jesus both from the Law of Moses and the Prophets from morning until evening.


## Acts 28:24 (id: 944028024)

24And while some were convinced by the things being said, others still did not believe.


## Acts 28:25 (id: 944028025)

25And being discordant with one another, they were leaving, Paul having spoken one word, “The Holy Spirit spoke well through Isaiah the prophet to your fathers,


## Acts 28:26 (id: 944028026)
