20If we had forgotten the name of our God and spread out our hands to a foreign god,

21would God not have discovered this? For he knows the secrets of the heart.

22Indeed, because of you we are killed all the day, we are considered {to be} like sheep of slaughtering.


## Psalms 44:23 (id: 919044023)

23Awake! Why do you sleep, Lord? Arise! Do not reject {us} forever!


## Psalms 44:24 (id: 919044024)

24Why do you hide your face and forget our affliction and our oppression?


## Psalms 44:25 (id: 919044025)

25For our life has sunk down into the dust, our belly has clung to the earth.


## Psalms 44:26 (id: 919044026)

26Rise up {as) our helper and redeem us because of your covenant faithfulness.

7It is certain that no one can redeem his brother or give God a ransom for him,

9No one can live forever so that his body should not decay.


## Psalms 49:10 (id: 919049010)

## Psalms 49:11 (id: 919049011)

11Their inner thought is that their families will continue forever, and the places where they live, to all generations; they call their lands after their own names.


## Psalms 49:12 (id: 919049012)

12But man, having wealth, does not remain alive; he is like the beasts that perish.


## Psalms 49:13 (id: 919049013)

13This, their way, is their folly; yet after them, men approve of their sayings. 


## Psalms 49:14 (id: 919049014)

14Like sheep they are appointed for Sheol, and death will be their shepherd. The upright will rule over them in the morning, and their bodies will be consumed in Sheol, with no place for them to live.

15But God will redeem my life from the power of Sheol; he will receive me. 


## Psalms 49:16 (id: 919049016)

16Do not be afraid when one becomes rich, and the glory of his house increases.


## Psalms 49:17 (id: 919049017)

17For when he dies he will take nothing away; his glory will not go down after him.


## Psalms 49:18 (id: 919049018)

18He blessed his soul while he lived— and men praise you when you live for yourself—


## Psalms 49:19 (id: 919049019)

## Psalms 49:20 (id: 919049020)

2Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God has shone.


## Psalms 50:3 (id: 919050003)

3Our God comes and does not stay silent; a fire devours before him, and it is very stormy around him.


## Psalms 50:4 (id: 919050004)

4He calls to the heavens above and to the earth so that he may judge his people:


## Psalms 50:5 (id: 919050005)

5“Gather my faithful ones together to me, those who have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.”


## Psalms 50:6 (id: 919050006)

6The heavens will declare his righteousness, for God himself is judge. 


## Psalms 50:7 (id: 919050007)

7“Israel, I will testify against you. Hear, my people, and I will speak; I am God, your God.


## Psalms 50:8 (id: 919050008)

8I will not reprove you for your sacrifices; your burnt offerings are always before me.


## Psalms 50:9 (id: 919050009)

9I will take no bull out of your house, or male goats out of your folds.


## Psalms 50:10 (id: 919050010)

10For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle on a thousand hills.


## Psalms 50:11 (id: 919050011)

11I know all the birds of the mountains, and the wild beasts of the field are mine.


## Psalms 50:12 (id: 919050012)

12If I were hungry, I would not tell you; for the world is mine, and everything in it.


## Psalms 50:13 (id: 919050013)

13Will I eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats?


## Psalms 50:14 (id: 919050014)

14Offer to God the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and pay your vows to the Most High.


## Psalms 50:15 (id: 919050015)

15Call on me in the day of trouble; I will rescue you, and you will glorify me.”


## Psalms 50:16 (id: 919050016)

16But to the wicked God says, “What have you to do with declaring my statutes, that you have taken my covenant in your mouth,


## Psalms 50:17 (id: 919050017)

17since you hate instruction and throw my words away?


## Psalms 50:18 (id: 919050018)

18When you see a thief, you agree with him; you participate with those who commit adultery.


## Psalms 50:19 (id: 919050019)

19You give your mouth to evil, and your tongue expresses deceit.


## Psalms 50:20 (id: 919050020)

20You sit and speak against your brother; you slander your own mother’s son.


## Psalms 50:21 (id: 919050021)

21You have done these things, but I have kept silent, so you thought that I was someone just like yourself. But I will reprove you and bring up, right before your eyes, all the things you have done.


## Psalms 50:22 (id: 919050022)

22Give this careful consideration, you who forget God, otherwise I will tear you to pieces, and there will be no one to come to help you!


## Psalms 50:23 (id: 919050023)

23The one who offers a sacrifice of thanksgiving praises me, and to anyone who plans his path in the right way I will show God’s salvation.”


## Psalms 51:1 (id: 919051001)

1For the chief musician. A psalm of David; when Nathan the prophet came to him after he had gone in to Bathsheba. Have mercy on me, God, because of your covenant faithfulness; for the sake of the multitude of your merciful actions, blot out my transgressions.


## Psalms 51:2 (id: 919051002)

2Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin.


## Psalms 51:3 (id: 919051003)

3For I know my transgressions, and my sin is always before me.


## Psalms 51:4 (id: 919051004)

4Against you, you only, I have sinned and done what is evil in your sight; you are right when you speak; you are correct when you judge.


## Psalms 51:5 (id: 919051005)

5See, I was born in iniquity; as soon as my mother conceived me, I was in sin.


## Psalms 51:6 (id: 919051006)

6See, you desire trustworthiness in my inner self; and you teach me wisdom in the secret place within.


## Psalms 51:7 (id: 919051007)

7Purify me with hyssop, and I will be clean; wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.


## Psalms 51:8 (id: 919051008)

12Restore to me the joy of your salvation, and sustain me with a willing spirit.


## Psalms 51:13 (id: 919051013)

13Then will I teach transgressors your ways, and sinners will be converted to you.


## Psalms 51:14 (id: 919051014)

14Forgive me for shedding blood, God of my salvation, and I will shout for the joy of your righteousness.


## Psalms 51:15 (id: 919051015)

15Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will express your praise.


## Psalms 51:16 (id: 919051016)

16For you do not delight in sacrifice, or I would give it; you have no pleasure in burnt offerings.


## Psalms 51:17 (id: 919051017)

17The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit. You, God, will not despise a broken and a contrite heart.


## Psalms 51:18 (id: 919051018)

18Do good in your good pleasure to Zion; rebuild the walls of Jerusalem.


## Psalms 51:19 (id: 919051019)

19Then will you delight in the sacrifices of righteousness, in burnt offerings and whole burnt offerings; then our people will offer bulls on your altar.


## Psalms 52:1 (id: 919052001)

1For the chief musician. A maschil of David; when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul, and said to him, “David has come to the house of Ahimelech.” Why are you proud of making trouble, you mighty man? The covenant faithfulness of God comes every day.


## Psalms 52:2 (id: 919052002)

2Your tongue plans destruction like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.


## Psalms 52:3 (id: 919052003)

3You love evil more than good and lying rather than speaking righteousness. 


## Psalms 52:4 (id: 919052004)

4You love all words that devour others, you deceitful tongue.


## Psalms 52:5 (id: 919052005)

5God will likewise destroy you forever; he will take you up and pluck you out of your tent and root you out of the land of the living. 


## Psalms 52:6 (id: 919052006)

6The righteous will also see it and fear; they will laugh at him and say,


## Psalms 52:7 (id: 919052007)

7“See, this is a man who did not make God his refuge, but he trusted in the abundance of his wealth, and he was strong when he destroyed others.”


## Psalms 52:8 (id: 919052008)

8But as for me, I am like a green olive tree in God’s house; I will trust in the covenant faithfulness of God forever and ever.


## Psalms 52:9 (id: 919052009)

9I will give you thanks forever for what you have done. I will wait for your name, because it is good, in the presence of your faithful ones.


## Psalms 53:1 (id: 919053001)

1For the chief musician; set to Mahalath. A maschil of David. A fool says in his heart, “There is no God.” They are corrupt and have done abominable iniquity; there is no one who does good.


## Psalms 53:2 (id: 919053002)

2God looks down from heaven on the children of mankind to see if there are any who understand, who seek after him.


## Psalms 53:3 (id: 919053003)

3They have all turned away. Together they have become corrupt. There is not one who does good, not even one.


## Psalms 53:4 (id: 919053004)

4Do those who commit iniquity have no understanding— those who devour my people as if they were eating bread and they do not call on God?


## Psalms 53:5 (id: 919053005)

5They were in great fear, although no reason to fear was there; for God will scatter the bones of whoever will camp against you; such people will be put to shame because God has rejected them.


## Psalms 53:6 (id: 919053006)

6Oh, that the salvation of Israel would come from Zion! When God brings back his people from the captivity, then Jacob will rejoice and Israel will be glad!


## Psalms 54:1 (id: 919054001)

1For the chief musician; on stringed instruments. A maschil of David; when the Ziphites came and said to Saul, “Does David not hide himself with us?” Save me, God, by your name, and judge me in your might.


## Psalms 54:2 (id: 919054002)

2Hear my prayer, God; give ear to the words of my mouth.


## Psalms 54:3 (id: 919054003)

3For strangers have risen up against me, and pitiless men have sought after my life; they have not set God before them. Selah


## Psalms 54:4 (id: 919054004)

4See, God is my helper; the Lord is the one who upholds me.


## Psalms 54:5 (id: 919054005)

5He will repay my enemies with evil; in your faithfulness, destroy them!


## Psalms 54:6 (id: 919054006)

6I will sacrifice to you with a freewill offering; I will give thanks to your name, Yahweh, for it is good.


## Psalms 54:7 (id: 919054007)

7For he has rescued me from every trouble; my eye has looked in triumph on my enemies.


## Psalms 55:1 (id: 919055001)

1For the chief musician; on stringed instruments. A maschil of David. Give ear to my prayer, God; and do not hide yourself from my plea.


## Psalms 55:2 (id: 919055002)

2Pay attention to me and answer me; I have no rest in my troubles


## Psalms 55:3 (id: 919055003)

3because of the voice of my enemies, because of the oppression of the wicked; for they bring trouble on me and persecute me in anger.


## Psalms 55:4 (id: 919055004)

4My heart trembles within me, and the terrors of death have fallen on me.


## Psalms 55:5 (id: 919055005)

5Fearfulness and trembling have come on me, and horror has overwhelmed me.


## Psalms 55:6 (id: 919055006)

6I said, “Oh, if only I had wings like a dove! Then would I fly away and be at rest.


## Psalms 55:7 (id: 919055007)

7See, then I would wander far away; I would stay in the wilderness. 


## Psalms 55:8 (id: 919055008)

8I would hurry to a shelter from the stormy wind and tempest.”


## Psalms 55:9 (id: 919055009)

9Devour them, Lord, confuse their language! For I have seen violence and strife in the city.


## Psalms 55:10 (id: 919055010)

10Day and night they go about on its walls; wickedness and trouble are in the middle of it.


## Psalms 55:11 (id: 919055011)

11Wickedness is in the middle of it; oppression and deceit do not leave its streets.


## Psalms 55:12 (id: 919055012)

12For it was not an enemy who rebuked me, then I could have borne it; neither was it he who hated me who raised himself up against me, then I would have hidden myself from him.


## Psalms 55:13 (id: 919055013)

13But it was you, a man equal to myself, my companion and my close friend.


## Psalms 55:14 (id: 919055014)

14We had sweet fellowship together; we walked in the house of God with the throng.


## Psalms 55:15 (id: 919055015)

15Let death come suddenly on them; let them go down alive to Sheol, for wickedness is where they live, right among them.


## Psalms 55:16 (id: 919055016)

16As for me, I will call on God, and Yahweh will save me.


## Psalms 55:17 (id: 919055017)

17In the evening, morning and at noonday I complain and moan; he will hear my voice.


## Psalms 55:18 (id: 919055018)

18He will safely rescue my life from the battle that was against me, for those who fought against me were many.


## Psalms 55:19 (id: 919055019)

19God, the one who rules from eternity, will hear them and humiliate them. They never change, and they do not fear God.


## Psalms 55:20 (id: 919055020)

5Do not lift up your horn to the heights; do not speak with an insolent neck.”


## Psalms 75:6 (id: 919075006)

6It is not from the east or from the west, and it is not from the wilderness that lifting up comes.


## Psalms 75:7 (id: 919075007)

7But God is the judge; he brings down one and he lifts up another.


## Psalms 75:8 (id: 919075008)

## Psalms 76:6 (id: 919076006)

6At your rebuke, God of Jacob, both rider and horse fell asleep.


## Psalms 76:7 (id: 919076007)

7You, yes you, are to be feared; who can stand in your sight when you are angry?


## Psalms 76:8 (id: 919076008)

8From heaven you made your judgment heard; the earth was afraid and silent


## Psalms 76:9 (id: 919076009)

9when you, God, arose to execute judgment and to save all the oppressed of the earth.

## Psalms 77:2 (id: 919077002)

2In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord; at night I stretched my hands out, and they would not become tired. My soul refused to be comforted.


## Psalms 77:3 (id: 919077003)

3I thought of God as I groaned; I thought about him as I grew faint. 


## Psalms 77:4 (id: 919077004)

## Psalms 77:7 (id: 919077007)

7Will the Lord reject me forever? Will he never again show me favor?


## Psalms 77:8 (id: 919077008)

## Psalms 77:9 (id: 919077009)

## Psalms 77:10 (id: 919077010)

10I said, “This is my sorrow: the changing of the right hand of the Most High toward us.”


## Psalms 77:11 (id: 919077011)

11But I will call to mind your deeds, Yahweh; I will think about your wonderful deeds of old.


## Psalms 77:12 (id: 919077012)

12I will ponder all your deeds and will reflect on them.


## Psalms 77:13 (id: 919077013)

13Your way, God, is holy; what god compares to our great God?


## Psalms 77:14 (id: 919077014)

14You are the God who does wonders; you have revealed your strength among the peoples.

2I will open my mouth in parables; I will sing about hidden things about the past.


## Psalms 78:3 (id: 919078003)

3These are things that we have heard and learned, things that our ancestors have told us.


## Psalms 78:4 (id: 919078004)

4We will not keep them from their descendants. We will tell the next generation about the praiseworthy deeds of Yahweh, his strength, and the wonders that he has done.


## Psalms 78:5 (id: 919078005)

5For he established covenant decrees in Jacob and appointed a law in Israel. He commanded our ancestors that they were to teach them to their children.


## Psalms 78:6 (id: 919078006)

6He commanded this so that the generation to come might know his decrees, the children not yet born, who should tell them in turn to their own children.


## Psalms 78:7 (id: 919078007)

7Then they would place their hope in God and not forget his deeds but keep his commandments.

8Then they would not be like their ancestors, who were a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation whose hearts were not right, and whose spirits were not committed and faithful to God.

9The Ephraimites were armed with bows, but they turned back on the day of battle.

11They forgot his deeds, the wonderful things that he had shown them.

14In the daytime he led them with a cloud and all the night with the light of fire.


## Psalms 78:15 (id: 919078015)

15He split the rocks in the wilderness, and he gave them water abundantly, enough to fill the depths of the sea.


## Psalms 78:16 (id: 919078016)

16He made streams flow out of the rock and made the water flow like rivers.


## Psalms 78:17 (id: 919078017)

17Yet they continued to sin against him, rebelling against the Most High in the wilderness.


## Psalms 78:18 (id: 919078018)

18They challenged God in their hearts by asking for food to satisfy their appetites.


## Psalms 78:19 (id: 919078019)

19They spoke against God; they said, “Can God really lay out a table for us in the wilderness?


## Psalms 78:20 (id: 919078020)

20See, when he struck the rock, waters gushed out and streams overflowed. But can he give bread also? Will he provide meat for his people?”


## Psalms 78:21 (id: 919078021)

21When Yahweh heard this, he was angry; so his fire burned against Jacob, and his anger attacked Israel,


## Psalms 78:22 (id: 919078022)

22because they did not believe in God and did not trust in his salvation.


## Psalms 78:23 (id: 919078023)

23Yet he commanded the skies above and opened the doors of the sky.


## Psalms 78:24 (id: 919078024)

24He rained down manna for them to eat, and gave them the grain from heaven.


## Psalms 78:25 (id: 919078025)

25People ate the bread of angels. He sent them food in abundance.


## Psalms 78:26 (id: 919078026)

26He caused the east wind to blow in the sky, and by his power he guided the south wind.


## Psalms 78:27 (id: 919078027)

27He rained down meat on them like dust, birds as numerous as the sands of the sea.


## Psalms 78:28 (id: 919078028)

28They fell in the middle of their camp, all around their tents.


## Psalms 78:29 (id: 919078029)

29So they ate and were full. He gave them what they craved.


## Psalms 78:30 (id: 919078030)

30But they had not yet filled up; their food was still in their mouths.


## Psalms 78:31 (id: 919078031)

31Then God’s anger attacked them and killed the strongest of them. He brought down the young men of Israel.


## Psalms 78:32 (id: 919078032)

32Despite this, they continued to sin and did not believe his wonderful deeds.


## Psalms 78:33 (id: 919078033)

33Therefore God cut short their days; their years were filled with terror.


## Psalms 78:34 (id: 919078034)

34Whenever God afflicted them, they would start to seek him, and they would return and look earnestly for him.


## Psalms 78:35 (id: 919078035)

35They would call to mind that God was their rock and that the Most High God was their rescuer.


## Psalms 78:36 (id: 919078036)

36But they would flatter him with their mouth and lie to him with their words.


## Psalms 78:37 (id: 919078037)

37For their hearts were not firmly fixed on him, and they were not faithful to his covenant.


## Psalms 78:38 (id: 919078038)

38Yet he, being merciful, forgave their iniquity and did not destroy them. Yes, many times he held back his anger and did not stir up all his wrath.


## Psalms 78:39 (id: 919078039)

39He called to mind that they were made of flesh, a wind that passes away and does not return.


## Psalms 78:40 (id: 919078040)

40How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness and grieved him in the barren regions!


## Psalms 78:41 (id: 919078041)

41Again and again they challenged God and offended the Holy One of Israel.


## Psalms 78:42 (id: 919078042)

42They did not think about his power, how he had rescued them from the enemy


## Psalms 78:43 (id: 919078043)

43when he performed his terrifying signs in Egypt and his wonders in the region of Zoan.


## Psalms 78:44 (id: 919078044)

44He turned the Egyptians’ rivers to blood so that they could not drink from their streams.


## Psalms 78:45 (id: 919078045)

45He sent swarms of flies that devoured them and frogs that overran their land.


## Psalms 78:46 (id: 919078046)

46He gave their crops to the grasshopper and their labor to the locust.


## Psalms 78:47 (id: 919078047)

47He destroyed their vines with hail and their sycamore trees with more hail.


## Psalms 78:48 (id: 919078048)

48He rained hail on their cattle and hurled lightning bolts at their livestock.


## Psalms 78:49 (id: 919078049)

49The fierceness of his anger lashed out against them. He sent wrath, fury, and trouble like agents who bring disaster.


## Psalms 78:50 (id: 919078050)

50He leveled a path for his anger; he did not spare them from death but gave them over to the plague.


## Psalms 78:51 (id: 919078051)

51He killed all the firstborn in Egypt, the firstborn of their strength in the tents of Ham.


## Psalms 78:52 (id: 919078052)

52He led his own people out like sheep and guided them through the wilderness like a flock.


## Psalms 78:53 (id: 919078053)

53He led them secure and unafraid, but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.


## Psalms 78:54 (id: 919078054)

54Then he brought them to the border of his holy land, to this mountain that his right hand acquired.


## Psalms 78:55 (id: 919078055)

55He drove out the nations from before them and assigned them their inheritance. He settled the tribes of Israel in their tents.


## Psalms 78:56 (id: 919078056)

56Yet they challenged and defied the Most High God and did not keep his solemn commands.


## Psalms 78:57 (id: 919078057)

57They were unfaithful and acted treacherously like their fathers; they were as undependable as a faulty bow.


## Psalms 78:58 (id: 919078058)

58For they made him angry with their high places and provoked him to jealous anger with their idols.


## Psalms 78:59 (id: 919078059)

59When God heard this, he was angry and completely rejected Israel.


## Psalms 78:60 (id: 919078060)

60He abandoned the sanctuary of Shiloh, the tent where he had lived among people.


## Psalms 78:61 (id: 919078061)

61He allowed his strength to be captured and gave his glory into the enemy’s hand.


## Psalms 78:62 (id: 919078062)

62He handed his people over to the sword, and he was angry with his heritage.


## Psalms 78:63 (id: 919078063)

63Fire devoured their young men, and their young women had no wedding songs.


## Psalms 78:64 (id: 919078064)

64Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows could not weep.


## Psalms 78:65 (id: 919078065)

65Then the Lord awakened as one from sleep, like a warrior who shouts because of wine.


## Psalms 78:66 (id: 919078066)

66He drove his adversaries back; he put them to everlasting shame.


## Psalms 78:67 (id: 919078067)

67He rejected the tent of Joseph, and he did not chose the tribe of Ephraim.


## Psalms 78:68 (id: 919078068)

68He chose the tribe of Judah and Mount Zion that he loved.


## Psalms 78:69 (id: 919078069)

69He built his sanctuary like the heavens, like the earth that he has established forever.

## Psalms 79:2 (id: 919079002)

2They have given the dead bodies of your servants as food to the birds of the skies, the bodies of your faithful ones to the beasts of the earth.


## Psalms 79:3 (id: 919079003)

3They have shed their blood like water around Jerusalem, and there was none to bury them.


## Psalms 79:4 (id: 919079004)

4We have become a reproach for our neighbors, mocking and derision to those who are around us.


## Psalms 79:5 (id: 919079005)

5How long, Yahweh? Will you stay angry forever? How long will your jealous anger burn like fire?


## Psalms 79:6 (id: 919079006)

6Pour out your wrath on the nations that do not know you and on the kingdoms that do not call upon your name.


## Psalms 79:7 (id: 919079007)

7For they have devoured Jacob and destroyed his villages.

8Do not hold the sins of our forefathers against us; may your merciful actions come to us, for we are very low.


## Psalms 79:9 (id: 919079009)

9Help us, God of our salvation, for the sake of the glory of your name; save us and forgive our sins for your name’s sake.


## Psalms 79:10 (id: 919079010)

10Why should the nations say, “Where is their God?” May the blood of your servants that was shed be avenged on the nations before our eyes.


## Psalms 79:11 (id: 919079011)

11May the groans of the prisoners come before you; with the greatness of your power keep the children of death alive.


## Psalms 79:12 (id: 919079012)

12Pay back into the laps of our neighboring countries seven times as much as the insults with which they have insulted you, Lord.

5You have fed them with the bread of tears and given them tears to drink in great quantities.

9You cleared the land for it; it took root and filled the land.


## Psalms 80:10 (id: 919080010)

10The mountains were covered with its shade, the cedars of God by its branches.


## Psalms 80:11 (id: 919080011)

11It sent out its branches as far as the sea and its shoots to the Euphrates River.


## Psalms 80:12 (id: 919080012)

12Why have you broken down its walls so that all who pass by along the road pluck its fruit?


## Psalms 80:13 (id: 919080013)

13The boars out of the forest ruin it, and the beasts of the field feed on it.

14Turn back, God of hosts; look down from heaven and take notice and take care of this vine.

6“I removed the burden from his shoulder; his hands were freed from holding the basket.


## Psalms 81:7 (id: 919081007)

7In your distress you called out, and I helped you; I answered you from a dark thundercloud. I tested you at the waters of Meribah.

8Listen, my people, for I will warn you, Israel, if you would only listen to me!

10I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt. Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.


## Psalms 81:11 (id: 919081011)

11But my people did not listen to my words; Israel did not obey me.


## Psalms 81:12 (id: 919081012)

12So I gave them over to their own stubborn way so that they might do what seemed right to them.


## Psalms 81:13 (id: 919081013)

13Oh, that my people would listen to me; oh, that my people would walk in my paths.


## Psalms 81:14 (id: 919081014)

14Then I would quickly subdue their enemies and turn my hand against their oppressors.

15May those who hate Yahweh cringe in fear before him! May they be humiliated forever.

## Psalms 104:6 (id: 919104006)

6You covered the earth with water like a garment; the water covered the mountains.


## Psalms 104:7 (id: 919104007)

7Your rebuke made the waters recede; at the sound of your thunderous voice they fled.


## Psalms 104:8 (id: 919104008)

8The mountains rose, and the valleys spread out into the places that you had appointed for them.


## Psalms 104:9 (id: 919104009)

9You have set a boundary for them that they will not cross; they will not cover the earth again.


## Psalms 104:10 (id: 919104010)

10He made springs flow into the valleys; the streams flow between the mountains.


## Psalms 104:11 (id: 919104011)

11They supply water for all the animals of the field; the wild donkeys quench their thirst.


## Psalms 104:12 (id: 919104012)

12By the heavens the birds build their nests; they sing among the branches.


## Psalms 104:13 (id: 919104013)

13He waters the mountains from his water chambers in the sky. The earth is filled with the fruit of his labor.

14He makes the grass grow for the cattle and plants for man to cultivate so that man may produce food from the earth.


## Psalms 104:15 (id: 919104015)

15He makes wine to make man happy, oil to make his face shine, and food to sustain his life.


## Psalms 104:16 (id: 919104016)

16The trees of Yahweh get plenty of rain; the cedars of Lebanon which he planted.


## Psalms 104:17 (id: 919104017)

17There the birds make their nests. The stork makes the cypress tree her home.


## Psalms 104:18 (id: 919104018)

18The wild goats live on the high mountains; the mountain heights are a refuge for the hyraxes.


## Psalms 104:19 (id: 919104019)

19He appointed the moon to mark the seasons; the sun knows its time for setting.


## Psalms 104:20 (id: 919104020)

20You make the darkness of the night when all the beasts of the forest come out.


## Psalms 104:21 (id: 919104021)

21The young lions roar for their prey and seek their food from God.


## Psalms 104:22 (id: 919104022)

22When the sun rises, they retreat and sleep in their dens.


## Psalms 104:23 (id: 919104023)

23Meanwhile, people go out to their work and labor away until the evening.


## Psalms 104:24 (id: 919104024)

24Yahweh, how many and varied are your works! With wisdom you made them all; the earth overflows with your works.


## Psalms 104:25 (id: 919104025)

25Over there is the sea, deep and wide, teeming with innumerable creatures, both small and great.


## Psalms 104:26 (id: 919104026)

26The ships travel there, and Leviathan is also there, which you formed to play in the sea.


## Psalms 104:27 (id: 919104027)

27All these look to you to give them their food on time.


## Psalms 104:28 (id: 919104028)

28When you give to them, they gather; when you open your hand, they are satisfied.


## Psalms 104:29 (id: 919104029)

29When you hide your face, they are troubled; if you take away their breath, they die and return to dust.


## Psalms 104:30 (id: 919104030)

30When you send out your Spirit, they are created, and you renew the countryside.


## Psalms 104:31 (id: 919104031)

31May the glory of Yahweh last forever; may Yahweh enjoy his creation.


## Psalms 104:32 (id: 919104032)

32He looks down on the earth, and it shakes; he touches the mountains, and they smoke.


## Psalms 104:33 (id: 919104033)

33I will sing to Yahweh all my life; I will sing praise to my God as long as I live.


## Psalms 104:34 (id: 919104034)

34May my thoughts be sweet to him; I will rejoice in Yahweh.


## Psalms 104:35 (id: 919104035)

35May sinners vanish from the earth, and let the wicked be no more. I give praise to Yahweh with all my life. Praise Yahweh.

1Give thanks to Yahweh, call on his name; make known his deeds among the nations.

3Boast in his holy name; let the heart of those who seek Yahweh rejoice.


## Psalms 105:4 (id: 919105004)

4Seek Yahweh and his strength; seek his presence continually.


## Psalms 105:5 (id: 919105005)

5Recall the marvelous things he has done, his miracles and the decrees from his mouth,


## Psalms 105:6 (id: 919105006)

6you descendants of Abraham his servant, you people of Jacob, his chosen ones.


## Psalms 105:7 (id: 919105007)

7He is Yahweh, our God. His decrees are on all the earth.

8He keeps in mind his covenant forever, the word that he commanded for a thousand generations.

9He calls to mind the covenant that he made with Abraham and his oath to Isaac.


## Psalms 105:10 (id: 919105010)

10This is what he confirmed to Jacob as a statute and to Israel as an everlasting covenant.


## Psalms 105:11 (id: 919105011)

11He said, “I will give you the land of Canaan as your share of your inheritance.”


## Psalms 105:12 (id: 919105012)

12He said this when they were only few in number, so very few, and were strangers in the land.


## Psalms 105:13 (id: 919105013)

13They went from nation to nation and from one kingdom to another.


## Psalms 105:14 (id: 919105014)

14He did not allow anyone to oppress them; he rebuked kings for their sakes.


## Psalms 105:15 (id: 919105015)

15He said, “Do not touch my anointed ones, and do not harm my prophets.”


## Psalms 105:16 (id: 919105016)

16He called for a famine on the land; he cut off the whole supply of bread.


## Psalms 105:17 (id: 919105017)

17He sent a man ahead of them; Joseph was sold as a servant.


## Psalms 105:18 (id: 919105018)

18His feet were bound by shackles; on his neck was put an iron collar,


## Psalms 105:19 (id: 919105019)

19until what he had said came to pass. The word of Yahweh tested him.


## Psalms 105:20 (id: 919105020)

20The king sent servants to release him; the ruler of the people set him free.


## Psalms 105:21 (id: 919105021)

21He put him in charge of his house as ruler of all his possessions


## Psalms 105:22 (id: 919105022)

22to instruct his princes as he wished and to teach his elders wisdom.


## Psalms 105:23 (id: 919105023)

23Then Israel came into Egypt, and Jacob lived for a time in the land of Ham.


## Psalms 105:24 (id: 919105024)

24Yahweh made his people fruitful, and made them stronger greatly than their enemies.


## Psalms 105:25 (id: 919105025)

25He caused their enemies to hate his people, to mistreat his servants.


## Psalms 105:26 (id: 919105026)

26He sent Moses, his servant, and Aaron, whom he had chosen.


## Psalms 105:27 (id: 919105027)

27They performed his signs among the Egyptians, his wonders in the land of Ham.


## Psalms 105:28 (id: 919105028)

28He sent darkness and made that land dark, but its people did not obey his commands.


## Psalms 105:29 (id: 919105029)

29He turned their water into blood and killed their fish.


## Psalms 105:30 (id: 919105030)

30Their land swarmed with frogs, even in the rooms of their rulers.


## Psalms 105:31 (id: 919105031)

31He spoke, and swarms of flies and gnats came throughout their country.


## Psalms 105:32 (id: 919105032)

32He turned their rain into hail, with fire flaming on their land.


## Psalms 105:33 (id: 919105033)

33He destroyed their vines and fig trees; he broke the trees of their country.


## Psalms 105:34 (id: 919105034)

34He spoke, and the locusts came, young locusts, without number.


## Psalms 105:35 (id: 919105035)

35The locusts ate up all of the vegetation in their land; They ate up all the crops of the ground.


## Psalms 105:36 (id: 919105036)

36He killed every firstborn in their land, the firstfruits of all their strength.


## Psalms 105:37 (id: 919105037)

37He brought the Israelites out with silver and gold; none of his tribes stumbled on the way.


## Psalms 105:38 (id: 919105038)

38Egypt was glad when they went away, for the fear of them had fallen upon them.


## Psalms 105:39 (id: 919105039)

39He spread a cloud for a covering and made a fire to light up the night.


## Psalms 105:40 (id: 919105040)

40The Israelites asked for food, and he brought quail and satisfied them with bread from heaven.


## Psalms 105:41 (id: 919105041)

41He split the rock, and waters gushed from it; they flowed in the wilderness like a river.


## Psalms 105:42 (id: 919105042)

42For he called to mind his holy promise that he made to Abraham his servant.


## Psalms 105:43 (id: 919105043)

43He led his people out with joy, his chosen with shouts of triumph.


## Psalms 105:44 (id: 919105044)

44He gave them the lands of the nations; they took possession of the wealth of the peoples


## Psalms 105:45 (id: 919105045)

45so that they might keep his statutes and obey his laws. Praise Yahweh.


## Psalms 106:1 (id: 919106001)

1Praise Yahweh. Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good, for his covenant faithfulness endures forever.


## Psalms 106:2 (id: 919106002)

2Who can recount the mighty acts of Yahweh or proclaim in full all his praiseworthy deeds?


## Psalms 106:3 (id: 919106003)

3Blessed are those who do what is right, and whose deeds are always just.


## Psalms 106:4 (id: 919106004)

4Call me to mind, Yahweh, when you show favor to your people; help me when you save them.


## Psalms 106:5 (id: 919106005)

5Then I will see the prosperity of your chosen, rejoice in the gladness of your nation, and glory with your inheritance.


## Psalms 106:6 (id: 919106006)

6We have sinned like our ancestors; we have done wrong, and we have done evil.


## Psalms 106:7 (id: 919106007)

7Our fathers did not appreciate your marvelous deeds in Egypt; they ignored your many acts of covenant faithfulness; they were rebellious at the sea, the Sea of Reeds.


## Psalms 106:8 (id: 919106008)

8Nevertheless, he saved them for his name’s sake so that he might reveal his power.


## Psalms 106:9 (id: 919106009)

9He rebuked the Sea of Reeds, and it dried up. Then he led them through the depths, as through a wilderness.


## Psalms 106:10 (id: 919106010)

10He saved them from the hand of those who hated them, and he rescued them from the hand of the enemy.


## Psalms 106:11 (id: 919106011)

11But the waters covered their adversaries; not one of them survived.


## Psalms 106:12 (id: 919106012)

12Then they believed his words, and they sang his praise.


## Psalms 106:13 (id: 919106013)

13But they quickly forgot what he had done; they did not wait for his instructions.


## Psalms 106:14 (id: 919106014)

14They had insatiable cravings in the wilderness, and they challenged God in the desert.


## Psalms 106:15 (id: 919106015)

15So he gave them what they requested, but he sent a horrible disease upon them.


## Psalms 106:16 (id: 919106016)

16In the camp they became jealous of Moses and Aaron, the holy priest of Yahweh.


## Psalms 106:17 (id: 919106017)

17The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan and covered the followers of Abiram.


## Psalms 106:18 (id: 919106018)

18Fire broke out among them; the fire consumed the wicked.


## Psalms 106:19 (id: 919106019)

19They made a calf at Horeb and worshiped a cast metal figure.


## Psalms 106:20 (id: 919106020)

20They traded the glory of God for the image of a bull that eats grass.


## Psalms 106:21 (id: 919106021)

21They forgot God their Savior, who had done great deeds in Egypt.


## Psalms 106:22 (id: 919106022)

22He had done wonderful things in the land of Ham and mighty acts at the Sea of Reeds.


## Psalms 106:23 (id: 919106023)

23So he said he would destroy them— had not Moses, his chosen one, stood in the breach before him, to turn away his anger from destroying them.


## Psalms 106:24 (id: 919106024)

24Then they despised the fruitful land; they did not believe his promise,


## Psalms 106:25 (id: 919106025)

25but grumbled in their tents, and did not obey Yahweh.


## Psalms 106:26 (id: 919106026)

26Therefore he raised his hand and swore to them that he would let them die in the desert,


## Psalms 106:27 (id: 919106027)

27scatter their descendants among the nations, and scatter them in foreign lands.


## Psalms 106:28 (id: 919106028)

28They worshiped the Baal of Peor and ate the sacrifices offered to the dead.


## Psalms 106:29 (id: 919106029)

29They provoked him to anger with their actions, and a plague broke out among them.


## Psalms 106:30 (id: 919106030)

30Then Phinehas rose to intervene, and the plague subsided.


## Psalms 106:31 (id: 919106031)

31It was counted to him as a righteous deed to all generations forever.


## Psalms 106:32 (id: 919106032)

32They also angered Yahweh at the waters of Meribah, and Moses suffered because of them.


## Psalms 106:33 (id: 919106033)

33They made Moses bitter, and he spoke rashly.


## Psalms 106:34 (id: 919106034)

34They did not destroy the nations as Yahweh had commanded them,


## Psalms 106:35 (id: 919106035)

35but they mingled with the nations and learned their ways


## Psalms 106:36 (id: 919106036)

36and worshiped their idols, which became a snare to them.


## Psalms 106:37 (id: 919106037)

37They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons.


## Psalms 106:38 (id: 919106038)

38They shed innocent blood, the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, desecrating the land with blood.


## Psalms 106:39 (id: 919106039)

39They were defiled by their deeds; in their actions they were like prostitutes.


## Psalms 106:40 (id: 919106040)

40So Yahweh was angry with his people, and he despised his own people.


## Psalms 106:41 (id: 919106041)

41He gave them into the hand of the nations, and those who hated them ruled over them.


## Psalms 106:42 (id: 919106042)

42Their enemies oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection to their authority.


## Psalms 106:43 (id: 919106043)

43Many times he came to help them, but they kept rebelling and were brought low by their own sin.


## Psalms 106:44 (id: 919106044)

44Nevertheless, he paid attention to their distress when he heard their cry for help.


## Psalms 106:45 (id: 919106045)

45He called to mind his covenant with them and relented because of his steadfast love.


## Psalms 106:46 (id: 919106046)

46He caused all their conquerers to have pity on them.


## Psalms 106:47 (id: 919106047)

47Save us, Yahweh, our God. Gather us from among the nations so that we may give thanks to your holy name and glory in your praises.


## Psalms 106:48 (id: 919106048)

48May Yahweh, the God of Israel, be praised from everlasting to everlasting. All the people said, “Amen.” Praise Yahweh.


## Psalms 107:1 (id: 919107001)

1Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good, and his covenant faithfulness endures forever.


## Psalms 107:2 (id: 919107002)

2Let the redeemed of Yahweh speak out, those he has rescued from the hand of the enemy.


## Psalms 107:3 (id: 919107003)

3He has gathered them out of foreign lands, from the east and from the west, from the north and from the south.


## Psalms 107:4 (id: 919107004)

4They wandered in the wilderness on a desert road and found no city in which to live.


## Psalms 107:5 (id: 919107005)

5Because they were hungry and thirsty, they fainted from exhaustion.


## Psalms 107:6 (id: 919107006)

6Then they called out to Yahweh in their trouble, and he rescued them out of their distress.


## Psalms 107:7 (id: 919107007)

7He led them by a direct path so that they would go to a city to live in.


## Psalms 107:8 (id: 919107008)

8Oh that people would praise Yahweh for his covenant faithfulness and for the amazing things he has done for humanity!


## Psalms 107:9 (id: 919107009)

9For he satisfies the longings of those who are thirsty, and the desires of those who are hungry he fills up with good things.


## Psalms 107:10 (id: 919107010)

10Some sat in darkness and in gloom, prisoners in affliction and chains.


## Psalms 107:11 (id: 919107011)

11This was because they had rebelled against God’s word and rejected the instruction of the Most High.


## Psalms 107:12 (id: 919107012)

12He humbled their hearts through hardship; they stumbled and there was no one to help them up.


## Psalms 107:13 (id: 919107013)

13Then they called out to Yahweh in their trouble, and he brought them out of their distress.


## Psalms 107:14 (id: 919107014)

14He brought them out of darkness and gloom and broke their bonds.


## Psalms 107:15 (id: 919107015)

15Oh that people would praise Yahweh for his covenant faithfulness and for the amazing things he has done for humanity!


## Psalms 107:16 (id: 919107016)

16For he has broken the gates of bronze and cut through the bars of iron.


## Psalms 107:17 (id: 919107017)

17They were foolish in their rebellious ways and afflicted because of their sins.


## Psalms 107:18 (id: 919107018)

18They lost their desire to eat any food, and they came close to the gates of death.


## Psalms 107:19 (id: 919107019)

19Then they called out to Yahweh in their trouble, and he brought them out of their distress.


## Psalms 107:20 (id: 919107020)

20He sent his word and healed them, and he rescued them from their destruction.


## Psalms 107:21 (id: 919107021)

21Oh that people would praise Yahweh for his covenant faithfulness and for the amazing things he has done for humanity!


## Psalms 107:22 (id: 919107022)

22Let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving and proclaim his deeds in singing.


## Psalms 107:23 (id: 919107023)

23Some travel on the sea in ships and do business overseas.


## Psalms 107:24 (id: 919107024)

24These saw the deeds of Yahweh and his wonders on the seas.


## Psalms 107:25 (id: 919107025)

25For he commanded and aroused the windstorm that stirs up the seas.


## Psalms 107:26 (id: 919107026)

26They reached up to the sky; they went down to the depths. Their lives melted away in distress.


## Psalms 107:27 (id: 919107027)

27They swayed and staggered like drunkards and were at their wits’ end.


## Psalms 107:28 (id: 919107028)

28Then they called out to Yahweh in their trouble, and he brought them out of their distress.


## Psalms 107:29 (id: 919107029)

29He calmed the storm, and the waves were stilled.


## Psalms 107:30 (id: 919107030)

30Then they rejoiced because they are quiet, so he brought them to their desired harbor.


## Psalms 107:31 (id: 919107031)

31Oh that people would praise Yahweh for his covenant faithfulness and for the amazing things he has done for humanity!


## Psalms 107:32 (id: 919107032)

32Let them exalt him in the assembly of the people and praise him in the council of the elders.


## Psalms 107:33 (id: 919107033)

33He turns rivers into a wilderness, springs of water into dry land,


## Psalms 107:34 (id: 919107034)

34and a fruitful land into a barren place because of the wickedness of those who dwell in it.


## Psalms 107:35 (id: 919107035)

35He turns the wilderness into a pool of water and dry land into springs of water.


## Psalms 107:36 (id: 919107036)

36He settles the hungry there, and they build a city to live in.


## Psalms 107:37 (id: 919107037)

37They sow fields and plant vineyards, that they may bring in a fruitful harvest.


## Psalms 107:38 (id: 919107038)

38He blesses them so they are very numerous. He does not let their cattle decrease in number.


## Psalms 107:39 (id: 919107039)

39They were diminished and brought low by painful distress and suffering.


## Psalms 107:40 (id: 919107040)

40He pours contempt on the leaders and causes them to wander in the wilderness, where there are no roads.


## Psalms 107:41 (id: 919107041)

41But he protects the needy from affliction and cares for his families like a flock.


## Psalms 107:42 (id: 919107042)

42The upright will see this and rejoice, and all wickedness shuts its mouth.


## Psalms 107:43 (id: 919107043)

43Whoever is wise should take note of these things and meditate on Yahweh’s acts of covenant faithfulness.


## Psalms 108:1 (id: 919108001)

1A song, a psalm of David. My heart is fixed, God; I will sing, yes, I will sing praises also with my honored heart.


## Psalms 108:2 (id: 919108002)

2Wake up, lute and harp; I will wake up the dawn.


## Psalms 108:3 (id: 919108003)

3I will give thanks to you, Yahweh, among the peoples; I will sing praises to you among the nations.


## Psalms 108:4 (id: 919108004)

4For your covenant faithfulness is great above the heavens; and your trustworthiness reaches to the skies.


## Psalms 108:5 (id: 919108005)

5Be exalted, God, above the heavens, and may your glory be exalted over all the earth.


## Psalms 108:6 (id: 919108006)
